## Decisions

### D1: Collaboration Framework

**Date:** 2025-10-24
**Status:** âš« Decided
**Decision Maker:** mcp-orchestration team (proposed), awaiting mcp-gateway confirmation

**Decision:**
- **Primary Communication:** GitHub Discussions (async-first)
- **Sync Calls:** Quarterly (optional, 30 minutes)
- **Decision Process:** Proposal â†’ Review (5-7 days) â†’ Discuss â†’ Document â†’ Implement
- **Capacity Model:** One-person team (mcp-orch), realistic expectations

**Rationale:**
- Async-first respects capacity constraints
- GitHub Discussions provides transparency
- Quarterly cadence for strategic alignment
- Low overhead, high value

**Documentation:** [RESPONSE.md](../../inbox/mcp-n8n(to%20be%20mcp-gateway)/RESPONSE.md#collaboration-framework)

---

### D2: Universal Loadability Format Adoption

**Date:** TBD (Week 7-8, Q1 2026)
**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ Pending Review
**Decision Maker:** mcp-orchestration team (after review)

**Options:**
1. **Full Adoption:** Implement `mcp-server.json` as specified
2. **Adoption with Extensions:** Implement with mcp-orch specific additions
3. **Dual Format:** Support both loadability + existing manifest
4. **Reject:** Do not adopt (unlikely if compatible)

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Compatibility with existing capability manifest
- Ecosystem benefit (cross-gateway compatibility)
- Implementation effort
- Maintenance burden

**Timeline:**
- Week 6: Receive specification
- Week 7: Review and evaluate
- Week 8: Decide and document

**Documentation:** To be created in `dev-docs/research/UNIVERSAL_LOADABILITY_REVIEW.md`

---

### D3: Authentication Mechanism

**Date:** TBD (Weeks 7-9, Q1 2026)
**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ Pending Alignment
**Decision Maker:** Both teams (joint decision)

**Proposed Baseline:** Bearer tokens

**Options:**
1. **Bearer Tokens Only:** Simple, industry standard
2. **Bearer + API Keys:** Flexibility for different use cases
3. **OAuth 2.0:** Enterprise-ready but complex
4. **Multiple Methods:** Support all of the above

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- n8n compatibility (credential handling)
- Security requirements
- Implementation complexity
- Developer experience

**Timeline:**
- Align during HTTP transport implementation
- Must be decided before Wave 2.0 completion

**Documentation:** To be documented in both repos after decision
