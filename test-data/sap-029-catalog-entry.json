Each SAP requires 5 artifacts with overlapping structure, leading to 10 hours of work per SAP.\n\nCurrent challenge: No automated way to generate SAP artifacts from metadata, resulting in inconsistent structure, manual duplication, and slow SAP creation velocity.\n\nDevelopers face: writing repetitive sections, maintaining consistency across 5 files, and tracking TODO placeholders.",
