        "background": "chora-base maintains SAP-001 (Inbox Coordination Protocol), which defines a 3-tier intake system for coordination requests, implementation tasks, and strategic proposals. Currently, creating these artifacts is a manual process: developers hand-craft JSON files with 15-20 required fields, ensuring schema compliance, consistent formatting, and proper event emission. While this works, it's time-intensive (30-60 minutes per coordination request) and error-prone.\n\nWe recently learned about chora-compose through ecosystem discussions and were intrigued by its approach to template-driven content generation. Our initial understanding was limited—we saw references in SAP-017/018 that suggested Docker orchestration, which didn't seem relevant. However, deeper research revealed that chora-compose is actually a content generation framework with 17 production generators and MCP integration, which could potentially automate our inbox artifact creation.\n\nBefore investing in integration work, we want to explore whether chora-compose is technically feasible and strategically aligned for inbox artifact automation. This request seeks your expertise in assessing compatibility between our SAP-001 schemas and your content generation architecture, understanding effort required, and determining whether a pilot makes sense for both teams."
