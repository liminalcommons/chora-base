        "rationale": "We considered three approaches to inbox artifact automation: (1) build custom tooling in chora-base, (2) adopt existing template engines like Jinja2 or Cookiecutter, or (3) integrate with chora-compose. Option 1 would give us full control but requires significant development and maintenance. Option 2 is simpler but lacks the MCP integration and ecosystem alignment we value.\n\nWe're pursuing Option 3 (chora-compose integration) because it offers the best balance of functionality, ecosystem synergy, and shared maintenance. chora-compose's 17 production generators demonstrate maturity, and MCP integration aligns with our vision for agent-assisted workflows. However, we need to validate technical feasibility before committing to this path.\n\nThis exploratory request will help us determine whether chora-compose's architecture can support our SAP-001 schemas, what effort is required, and whether integration makes sense for both teams. If feasibility is high (≥80%), we'll proceed to a 4-week pilot. If lower, we'll fall back to Option 2 (template engine) or Option 1 (custom tooling)."
