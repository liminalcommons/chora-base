Map to one or more deliverables (verify what was requested)\n2. Be objectively verifiable (tool-based or clear manual process)\n3. Include quantitative thresholds where applicable (≥80%, <100ms, ≥3 examples)\n4. Be phrased as positive condition ('X passes Y' not 'X doesn't fail Y')\n5. Be independently testable\n\nRequest type patterns:\n- Exploratory (4-10 criteria): Coverage (addresses X, includes Y), completeness (≥N examples), structure (follows framework)\n- Prescriptive (8-15 criteria): Tests pass (≥80% coverage), benchmarks (<100ms), validation (schema passes), documentation (≥85% clarity)\n- Peer Review (5-10 criteria): Review depth (≥3 comparisons), actionability (≥5 suggestions), constructiveness (specific examples)\n\nIf user provided acceptance_criteria, refine them to be measurable. If not provided, derive from deliverables.",
