  "description": "chora-compose v1.9.0 introduces stigmergic context links and freshness tracking that enable efficient cross-repository coordination. This coordination request proposes updating chora-base documentation to leverage these new capabilities for SAP documentation maintenance and cross-repo workflows.\n\nKey changes in v1.9.0:\n- Stigmergic context links: 95% token reduction (20k→1k) for cross-repo operations\n- Freshness tracking: Automated staleness detection with check_freshness tool\n- Collections documentation: Complete reference for 3-tier content generation\n\nProposed updates to chora-base:\n1. Add stigmergic context links to AGENTS.md for SAP regeneration\n2. Document freshness tracking workflow for SAP maintenance\n3. Update cross-repo coordination examples in relevant SAPs\n4. Add CI/CD integration examples for automated freshness checks",

These features were specifically designed to address token efficiency and maintenance challenges when chora-base needs to regenerate SAP documentation. The coordination request COORD-2025-002 (SAP generation via Collections) successfully demonstrated the technical feasibility. Now we need to update documentation to make these capabilities discoverable and usable."
