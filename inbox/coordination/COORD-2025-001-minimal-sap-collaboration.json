  "context": "chora-workspace has designed SAP-019 to address ecosystem entry friction. Current barrier: 18 SAPs (~100k tokens, 2-4 weeks) required for participation. SAP-019 reduces this to 5 essential SAPs (~29k tokens, 3-5 hours) for Bronze tier entry. This spike is part of broader initiative to enable agent onboarding across chora ecosystem repos via minimal SAP package teaching, prioritizing parallel execution where ecosystem-level scope complements local work.",
