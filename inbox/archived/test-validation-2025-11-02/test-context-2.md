# Context for Ecosystem Discovery CLI Tool

## Title
Add Ecosystem Discovery CLI Tool

## Description
Implement automated discovery service registry for SAP-001 v1.2 enabling repos to find each other by capability.

## Background
Currently discovery is manual via capability registry YAML files. Repos must manually grep or search to find who provides specific capabilities. This doesn't scale beyond 5-10 repos.

## Rationale
Enable seamless repo discovery for coordination. Support the vision of 20+ repo ecosystem where agents can automatically find the right repo to coordinate with. Reduce friction in cross-repo collaboration.

## Priority
P2 - Important for Phase 2

## Urgency
planned - Roadmapped for Q1 2026
