# Context for Inbox Monitoring Automation

## Title
Create Inbox Monitoring Automation

## Description
Implement automated inbox monitoring for AI agents with configurable alerts and session startup integration.

## Background
Agents currently check inbox manually at session startup using inbox-query.py. There's no automated notification when high-priority items arrive. This could cause SLA violations for blocks_sprint urgency items.

## Rationale
Reduce response time and improve SLA compliance. Enable proactive inbox monitoring rather than reactive checking. Support the 4-hour acknowledgment SLA for blocks_sprint items.

## Priority
P1 - Critical for SLA compliance

## Urgency
blocks_sprint - Blocking current sprint as we have active ecosystem coordination
