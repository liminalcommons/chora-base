  "from_repo": "github.com/liminalcommons/chora-base",
  "to_repo": "github.com/liminalcommons/chora-base",
  "priority": "P2",
  "urgency": "planned",
  "deliverables": [
    "CLI tool that queries capability registry and returns matching repos by capability name",
    "Service discovery API supporting fuzzy search across all registered SAP-001 capabilities",
    "Automated registry validation ensuring all repos have valid capability declarations",
    "Integration tests verifying discovery across minimum 3 test repositories",
    "Documentation with usage examples for finding repos by capability type",
    "Performance benchmark supporting sub-second queries across 50+ registered repos",
    "GitHub Action workflow for automatic registry updates on capability changes",
    "Migration guide for converting existing manual discovery workflows to automated CLI"
  ],
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "CLI tool discovers repos by querying \u22653 capability types from registry files",
    "Discovery completes in <5 seconds for ecosystem of 20 repos",
    "Tool outputs structured JSON with repo name, capabilities, and contact info",
    "Command supports filtering by capability tags with \u226590% accuracy",
    "Documentation includes 3+ usage examples for common discovery scenarios",
    "Tool validates registry YAML format and reports errors with line numbers",
    "Integration test suite covers \u22655 discovery scenarios with 100% pass rate",
    "CLI returns helpful error messages for 404/network failures within 2 seconds"

  "context": {
    "background": "Currently discovery is manual via capability registry YAML files. Repos must manually grep or search to find who provides specific capabilities. This doesn't scale beyond 5-10 repos.",
    "rationale": "Enable seamless repo discovery for coordination. Support the vision of 20+ repo ecosystem where agents can automatically find the right repo to coordinate with. Reduce friction in cross-repo collaboration."
