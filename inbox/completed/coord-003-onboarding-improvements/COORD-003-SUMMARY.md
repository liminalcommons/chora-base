## Key Observations Submitted

### Ergonomics Improvements (4 observations)

1. **No visual decision tree** → Add flowchart for SAP set selection
2. **Success criteria unclear** → Add explicit checklists per tier
3. **Dependency graph text-only** → Add mermaid diagram
4. **Common pitfalls undocumented** → Create FAQ section

### Efficiency Improvements (4 observations)

1. **No pre-flight validation** → Create prerequisite checker script
2. **No progress indicators** → Add progress bars during installation
3. **Post-install verification scattered** → Consolidate validation commands
4. **No custom .chorabase template** → Provide commented example

### Effectiveness Improvements (4 observations)

1. **Time estimates vs actuals not tracked** → Add optional telemetry
2. **Agent-specific guides buried** → Create quickstart-claude.md variants
3. **No session handoff mechanism** → Add checkpoint/resume system
4. **Success metrics undefined** → Define clear metrics per tier
