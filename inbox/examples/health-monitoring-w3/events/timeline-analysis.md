## Phase 1: Strategic Planning (Weeks 1-2)

**Duration**: 2 days
**Events**: 9

### Timeline
```
2025-10-27 10:00 → Proposal created (prop-001)
2025-10-27 10:05 → Under review
2025-10-29 14:00 → Accepted
```

### Analysis
- **Fast decision**: 2-day turnaround from creation to acceptance
- **Clear strategic value**: "Critical blocker for production use"
- **No blocking concerns**: Proposal well-researched and scoped

### Lesson
Strategic proposals with clear business value and well-defined scope accelerate through review.

---

## Phase 2: RFC & ADR (Weeks 3-4)

**Duration**: 11 days
**Events**: 3

### Timeline
```
2025-10-30 09:00 → RFC 0001 created
2025-11-03 09:00 → FCP started (7-day comment period)
2025-11-10 17:00 → FCP ended, RFC accepted
2025-11-10 17:30 → ADR 0001 created
2025-11-10 18:00 → ADR 0001 accepted
```

### Analysis
- **FCP discipline**: 7-day Final Comment Period allowed for review
- **No blocking concerns**: RFC was well-specified
- **Same-day ADR**: Technical decision (JSON schema) was straightforward
- **Clear contract**: ADR 0001 enabled parallel work across repos

### Lesson
Invest time in RFC/ADR quality upfront. Clear technical contracts enable parallel implementation.

2025-11-12 10:15 → coord-004 triaged (next_sprint)
```

### Analysis
- **Batch creation**: All 4 coordination requests created in 15 minutes
- **Sprint planning**: Triaged next day during sprint planning
- **Priority-based sequencing**: P0 requests (coord-001, coord-002) scheduled for Sprint 4, P1 requests (coord-003, coord-004) for Sprints 5-6
- **Dependency-aware**: coord-003 depends on coord-002, scheduled accordingly

### Lesson

## Recommendations

### For Future Waypoints

1. **Front-load ADRs**: ADR 0001 enabled parallel work. Create ADRs early for cross-repo features.

2. **Batch coordination requests**: Creating all 4 requests together enabled holistic planning.

3. **Prioritize foundation tasks**: P0 tasks (task-001, task-002) unblocked everything else.

4. **Plan for weekends**: Friday PR creation → Monday merge. Avoid Friday code freezes.

5. **Integration testing**: 9 integration tests caught edge cases. Invest in integration tests for cross-repo work.

### For Inbox System

1. **Event correlation works**: 67 events, single trace_id, complete audit trail.

2. **Fulfillment notifications work**: All 4 coordination requests notified requesting repo.

3. **Phase tracking works**: DDD → BDD → TDD phases tracked in events, enabled metrics.

4. **Consider event types**: 15 event types tracked complete lifecycle. May need more granular events for debugging.

- ✅ Strategic process respected (proposal → RFC → ADR)
- ✅ Coordination enabled parallel work
- ✅ Implementation followed disciplined workflow
- ✅ Event correlation provided complete audit trail
