  "title": "Explore Potential Collaboration on Structured Documentation Generation",

  "description": "chora-base is exploring generation-based SAP (Skilled Awareness Package) artifacts and wondering if there's alignment with chora-compose's vision. This is an exploratory request to understand capabilities and potential collaboration, NOT a requirements prescription or implementation request.",

  "context": {
    "our_situation": "chora-base maintains 18 SAPs (documentation packages), each with 5 artifacts (charter, protocol, guide, blueprint, ledger). Currently hand-written (~8-12 hours per SAP). Exploring whether generation from constituent content blocks could reduce effort while maintaining quality.",

    "why_reaching_out": "SAP-017 and SAP-018 document chora-compose as Docker Compose orchestration for AI agent development environments. We're reaching out because: (1) the name 'chora-compose' suggests composition capabilities, and (2) we want to understand if documentation generation is within your project's scope/vision, even if not currently implemented.",

    "not_assuming": "We are NOT assuming chora-compose is a content generation tool. We understand you focus on Docker orchestration. This request is exploratory - if documentation generation is out of scope, that's completely fine and we'll explore other approaches.",

    "our_vision": "Collections as higher-level holons (bundles of SAPs) with potential for context-aware artifact generation. See docs/design/collections-exploration-notes.md in chora-base for details.",

    "timeline": "No urgency. v4.1.0 (Q1 2026) ships with storage-based SAP sets (doesn't need chora-compose). This exploration is for potential v4.2.0 (Q2 2026+) if aligned."
