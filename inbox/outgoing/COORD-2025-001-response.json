  "summary": "We've reviewed the SAP-019 proposal and identified a strategic solution that solves the lightweight entry problem while maintaining v4.0's flexible adoption philosophy. Instead of creating a formal SAP-019, we'll enhance Wave 5 (SAP Installation Tooling) with a 'SAP sets' feature that provides one-line installation of curated SAP bundles.",

  "rationale": {
    "problem_acknowledged": "Ecosystem onboarding friction is a valid pain point. Current barrier of 18 SAPs (~100k tokens, 2-4 weeks) creates significant adoption friction for cross-repo coordination.",

    "solution_refined": "SAP sets solve the lightweight entry problem without introducing prescriptive tier terminology. This maintains v4.0's philosophy of flexible adoption while providing convenience groupings.",

    "key_advantages": [
      "Enables multiple entry pathways, not just one 'Bronze tier'",
      "Lower maintenance burden (catalog entry vs 5 SAP artifacts)",
      "Projects can define custom sets in .chorabase for organizational standards",
      "Aligns with v4.0 flexible adoption philosophy (convenience, not prescription)",
      "Generalizable pattern supporting multiple use cases (testing-focused, MCP, etc.)",
      "One-line installation: python scripts/install-sap.py --set minimal-entry"
    ],

    "why_not_formal_sap_019": [
      "Bronze/Silver/Gold tier terminology conflicts with v4.0 flexible adoption model",
      "Formal SAP requires 5 artifacts to maintain perpetually",
      "Doesn't generalize to other minimal entry patterns (testing, MCP, etc.)",
      "SAP sets provide same benefit with more flexibility and less overhead"
