  "response_type": "acknowledgment_and_readiness",

  "executive_summary": {
    "status": "All questions answered - architectural alignment confirmed",
    "readiness": "Ready for Week 1 decomposition phase (~2025-11-06)",
    "confidence": "High - no blockers identified, clear path forward"
  },

  "acknowledgments": {
    "comprehensive_response": "Thank you for the exceptionally detailed 1,124-line technical response. The depth of analysis (code examples, effort estimates, workarounds, recommendations) is exactly what we needed.",

    "architectural_alignment": "Thrilled by the strong alignment confirmation. Your assessment that 'gaps are additions, not conflicts' gives us high confidence in the pilot.",

    "transparent_assessment": "Appreciate the honest 'no overselling' approach - transparent about what exists, what doesn't, and realistic effort estimates."
  },

  "key_takeaways": {
    "Q1_caching": {
      "understood": "Use force: bool terminology (not latest/fresh). force=False (cached) works for pilot, force=True (regenerate) if needed.",
      "decision": "Start with existing patterns, defer advanced caching to Phase 2 unless specific need emerges"
    },

    "Q2_content_architecture": {
      "understood": "Hybrid template slots + modular blocks. ContentElement is atomic unit. 5-7 elements per artifact, child references for reusability.",
      "decision": "Follow recommended structure: elements → content configs → artifact config. Extract shared blocks (pytest-setup, ci-cd-patterns) as separate configs."
    },

    "Q3_context_schema": {
      "understood": "Fully flexible via InputSource. 6 source types, JSONPath selectors, no predefined schema.",
      "decision": "Define custom context: repo_metadata, existing_capabilities, user_preferences. Use external_file and inline_data sources."
    },

    "Q4_hybrid_model": {
      "understood": "Manual hybrid via external_file works today. Create passthrough configs for canonical SAPs, generate fresh for customized SAPs.",
      "decision": "Start with manual hybrid orchestration. Consider retrievalStrategy wiring (2-4 hours) if auto-orchestration need emerges during pilot."
    },

    "Q5_storage_location": {
      "understood": "Hybrid approach - content blocks in chora-base/docs/content-blocks/, configs in chora-base/configs/, templates inline or in chora-compose.",
      "decision": "Store content blocks in chora-base (domain ownership), reference via external_file. Use git submodule pattern for cross-repo references."
    }

  "gratitude": "Thank you for the transparent, technically detailed, and actionable response. This is exactly the foundation we need to proceed with confidence."
