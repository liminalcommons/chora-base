## Communication Stream 1: FROM chora-workspace

### coord-005: Peer Review: Ecosystem Coordination SAPs Proposal

**Type**: Internal peer review request (chora-workspace → chora-base)
**Status**: ✅ **Accepted** (review completed 2025-10-31)
**Decision**: **Proceed with Option A** (New SAP-014: Coordination Patterns + SAP-015: Commons Philosophy)

#### Materials Reviewed (4 documents, ~9,500 words)

1. **LIMINAL_COMMONS_CONTEXT.md** (~2,000 words)
   - Purpose: Explain Acropolis OS vision and chora-workspace's role
   - Assessment: ✅ Accurate representation of vision and values

2. **ECOSYSTEM_PHILOSOPHY.md** (~2,500 words)
   - Purpose: Articulate 7 core principles (kin-based collaboration, bounded rationality, etc.)
   - Assessment: ✅ Strongly resonates with chora-base values

3. **prop-002-ecosystem-coordination-saps.md** (~5,000 words)
   - Purpose: Formal SAP proposal with 3 options (new SAPs vs modify vs hybrid)
   - Assessment: ✅ Well-structured with clear options and evidence

4. **coord-005-chora-base-sap-peer-review.json**
   - Purpose: Formal coordination request with 17 specific questions
   - Assessment: ✅ Excellent depth, follows inbox protocol

#### Key Findings

**Philosophy Alignment**: ✅ All 7 principles align with chora-base values
- We Are Us (kin-based collaboration)
- Emergent Aims Over Prescribed Plans
- Bounded Rationality & Humble Uncertainty
- Provide Value Freely, Without Inhibition
- Generative Contexts (Humans + AI)
- Attunement & Discernment Over Deference
- Commons Orientation & Network Effects

**SAP Structure Decision**: New SAP-014 + SAP-015 (Not modify existing)
- SAP-014: Ecosystem Coordination Patterns (technical)
- SAP-015: Commons Philosophy & Symbiotic Intelligence (foundational, referenced by all SAPs)

**Tone Assessment**: A- (Excellent with minor refinements)
- Bounded rationality consistently applied
- "Observed patterns" vs "proven patterns" language
- Humble, peer-based communication

**v4.0 Alignment**: ✅ Directly supports ecosystem growth objective
- Right timing (4 sprints evidence, W3 pending)
- Identified 6 gaps for scaling (conflict resolution, capacity routing, etc.)
- Proceed now, address scaling in Phase 3-4

#### Next Steps (6-week timeline)

**Week 1-2** (Now): Peer review complete, incorporate feedback
**Week 3-4**: SAP definition phase (draft SAP-014/015)
**Week 5-6**: Adoption phase (chora-workspace + 1 peer repo)

## Communication Stream 2: FROM chora-compose

### Two Active Collaborations

#### A. COORD-2025-003: v1.9.0 Capabilities Documentation (Active, This Week)

**Status**: ✅ Accepted (2025-10-30), implementation in progress
**Priority**: Medium
**Timeline**: 2025-W44
**Estimated Effort**: 2.75-4.25 hours

**What It Is**:
- Update chora-base documentation to reference chora-compose v1.9.0 features
- Stigmergic context links: 95% token reduction (20k→1k)
- Freshness tracking: Automated staleness detection for SAP maintenance

**Deliverables** (5 acceptance criteria):

2. SAP maintenance workflow documented with freshness tracking
3. CI/CD example for automated freshness checks
4. Bidirectional cross-references between repos
5. Validation via generating at least one SAP

**Location**: `/Users/victorpiper/code/chora-base/inbox/active/coord-2025-003-v190-capabilities-update/`

**Status**: Pilot confirmed, Week 1 decomposition starts ~2025-11-06
**Decision Date**: 2025-11-19
**Quality Threshold**: 80% of hand-written SAP quality

**What It Is**:

- Pilot target: SAP-004 (Testing Framework) as proof-of-concept
- chora-base role: Reactive support (provide SAP-004 decomposition when requested)

**chora-compose Response**: "STRONG ALIGNMENT!" - documentation generation is their core capability

**Communication Thread** (7 files in `/inbox/incoming/coordination/`):
1. COORD-2025-002-chora-compose-exploration.json
2. COORD-2025-002-response.json

## Communication Stream 3: TO ecosystem-manifest

### Outgoing Invitation (Not actionable for chora-base)

**Type**: Invitation from chora-workspace to ecosystem-manifest
**Status**: Sent 2025-10-31, response due 2025-11-14
**Problem**: ecosystem-manifest repository doesn't exist yet

**Related Materials** (in `/inbox/ecosystem/`, not for chora-base action):

1. **ECOSYSTEM_COORDINATION_ANNOUNCEMENT.md** (~6,000 words)
   - General announcement to Liminal Commons repos
   - Introduces chora-workspace as coordination hub
   - Evidence: 70% acceptance rate, 82-142% ROI, 0% defects

2. **ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md** (~4,000 words)
   - Step-by-step tutorial for repositories joining coordination hub
   - 3 participation levels: Full (45min), Capability (15min), Observer (0min)

3. **START_HERE.md**
   - 3-minute entry point for invitation recipients
   - Points to invitations, explains options

4. **invitations/ecosystem-manifest-invitation.md**
   - Personalized invitation
   - Pre-filled capability template
   - W3 Health Monitoring role explained

**These are chora-workspace's outreach to grow the coordination ecosystem** - not action items for chora-base review.

---

## Relationships Between Streams

### Independent Tracks (For Now)

1. **chora-workspace SAP proposal** (coord-005)
   - Internal peer review
   - About formalizing coordination patterns as SAPs
   - Independent of chora-compose work

2. **chora-compose collaborations** (CORD-002, CORD-003)
   - External partnership
   - About using their tools + documenting features
   - Independent of chora-workspace proposals

3. **Ecosystem invitations**
   - Outgoing from chora-workspace
   - Not action items for chora-base
   - About growing coordination ecosystem

### Potential Future Intersection

**IF coord-005 approved** (ecosystem coordination SAPs):
- SAP-014 might include patterns from CORD-002 pilot (if successful)
- SAP-015 philosophy might inform chora-compose collaboration framing
- Coordination templates might leverage chora-compose v1.9.0 stigmergic links

**But these are separate decision tracks right now.**

## Key Decisions Made

### coord-005 Peer Review Decision

✅ **ACCEPT and PROCEED with SAP Formalization**

**Option Selected**: Option A (New SAPs) with Cross-Reference Integration
- Create SAP-014: Ecosystem Coordination Patterns
- Create SAP-015: Commons Philosophy & Symbiotic Intelligence (foundational)
- Ensure SAP-015 referenced by all existing SAPs for tone/values
- Integrate coordination templates into chora-base (progressive tiers)

**Rationale**:
- Evidence sufficient (4 sprints, 82-142% ROI, 0% defects)
- Strategic timing (v4.0, W3, ecosystem expansion)
- Philosophy strongly aligns with chora-base values
- Clear structure (new SAPs better than modifying existing)
- Low risk (progressive adoption, can evolve based on feedback)

**Changes to Incorporate**:
- Minor tone refinements ("observed" vs "proven")
- Gameworld terminology clarification
- Template versioning strategy (Git + semver)
- Scaling considerations documented
- External contributor translation guide

**Next Phase**: Week 3-4 SAP definition (incorporating peer review feedback)
