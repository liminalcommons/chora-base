  "context": {
    "background": "Foundation tools for bidirectional translation layer are complete (Phase 1 of BIDIRECTIONAL_COMMUNICATION.md): intent-router.py, chora-search.py, suggest-next.py, INTENT_PATTERNS.yaml, GLOSSARY.md, user-preferences.yaml.template. These tools enable mutual ergonomics between conversational input and procedural execution. However, integration work (Phase 2-4) remains incomplete - agents don't yet 'just know' how to use these tools as native and second nature. This coordination request establishes governance for completing the integration following proper DDD → BDD → TDD lifecycle.",

    "related_sap": "SAP-009 (agent-awareness) v1.0.0 → v1.1.0",

    "traceability_context": "Emerged from exploration of traceability applicability across SAPs. User requested dogfooding approach to prove value and integrate into repo vision/strategy/planning. After initial foundation work, user correctly noted we must 'use our process and including governance and administrative doc updates where appropriate' - hence this coordination request following proper intake protocol."
  },

  "deliverables": [
    "Enhanced SAP-009 protocol-spec.md (Section 9: Bidirectional Translation Layer)",
    "Enhanced SAP-009 awareness-guide.md (Integration patterns for generic agents)",
    "Enhanced SAP-009 ledger.md (v1.1.0 adoption tracking)",
    "Enhanced root AGENTS.md (tool discovery and usage patterns) - ALREADY COMPLETE",
    "Enhanced domain AGENTS.md files (5 SAPs: 001, 004, 009, 012, 013) with user signal patterns",
    "Integration of suggestion engine with inbox protocol (proactive context-aware suggestions)",
    "BDD scenarios validating intent recognition, preference adaptation, pattern learning",
    "Test coverage ≥85% for integration code",
    "CHANGELOG.md entry for v4.1.3 release",
    "SAP Index update (SAP-009 v1.0.0 → v1.1.0)",

  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "Intent recognition accuracy ≥80% on test query set (30+ queries)",
    "Generic agents (Claude, Cursor, etc.) can discover and use tools via documentation alone",
    "Tools gracefully degrade (missing tool → fall back to documented patterns)",
    "User preferences successfully adapt agent behavior across all 100+ config options",
    "Pattern learning captures new variations without breaking existing patterns",
    "Suggestion engine provides context-aware recommendations based on project state",
    "All BDD scenarios pass (intent routing, glossary search, context analysis, preference loading)",
    "Test coverage ≥85%",
    "No lint/type errors",
    "Documentation follows Diátaxis framework",
    "SAP-009 enhancement properly versioned (v1.0.0 → v1.1.0)",
    "CHANGELOG follows semantic versioning (v4.1.2 → v4.1.3 PATCH release)"
