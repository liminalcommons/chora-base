    "background": "chora-base uses SAP-001 Inbox Coordination Protocol with a 3-tier intake system (coordination, task, proposal). Creating coordination requests manually currently takes 30-60 minutes of focused effort. chora-compose is a content generation framework with 17 production generators and MCP integration, designed for template-based and AI-augmented content creation.\n\nThis exploration assesses whether chora-compose can reduce coordination request generation time to 5-10 minutes while maintaining ≥80% quality. The investigation will examine architectural compatibility, content block decomposition, generation patterns, and post-processing requirements.\n\nSuccess would enable significant productivity gains for chora-base contributors and provide a scalable foundation for task and proposal generation.",
    "rationale": "We considered three approaches: (1) manual templates with copy-paste, (2) chora-compose integration with content blocks, (3) custom Python generator. Manual templates lack validation and consistency. Custom generators require ongoing maintenance. chora-compose offers reusable content blocks, MCP integration, active maintenance, and a proven track record with 17 production generators. We chose an exploratory approach to validate feasibility and measure quality before committing to full implementation.",
    "not_requesting": "We are NOT asking chora-compose to modify its core architecture. We are NOT expecting you to implement our automation or maintain chora-base-specific tooling. This exploration does NOT commit us to adoption. We are NOT requesting urgent timeline or priority treatment."
