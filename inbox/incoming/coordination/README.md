# Coordination Requests

**Intake Type:** Type 2 - Coordination Request
**Review Frequency:** Every 2 weeks (Sprint Planning)
**Decision Makers:** Product + Engineering Leads
**Phase:** Phase 2 (Planning & Prioritization)

---

## Purpose

This directory contains **cross-repo coordination requests** - work that needs to be scheduled and prioritized in sprint planning because it affects multiple repositories or has dependencies.

## When to Use

Create a coordination request here when:
- üîó Work spans multiple repos (e.g., "ecosystem-manifest needs to deliver spec for mcp-orchestration")
- üì¶ Work has dependencies on other repos
- üöß Work blocks other teams' progress
- ‚è±Ô∏è Work has specific timing requirements
- üéØ Work is part of coordinated release (e.g., Waypoint W3)

**Do NOT use for:**
- ‚ùå Strategic proposals (use `inbox/ecosystem/proposals/`)
- ‚ùå Single-repo tasks already in sprint (use `inbox/incoming/tasks/`)
- ‚ùå Completed work (use `inbox/completed/`)

---

## Request Format

Coordination requests are JSON files following this schema:

```json

## Review Process (Sprint Planning)

### Every 2 Weeks

1. **Review all coordination requests**
   - Check priority and urgency
   - Verify dependencies are met
   - Assess capacity for this sprint

2. **Triage Decision:**
   - **‚úÖ This Sprint** ‚Üí Add to sprint backlog, generate task
   - **‚è≠Ô∏è Next Sprint** ‚Üí Keep in queue, add to backlog with priority
   - **‚ùå Reject** ‚Üí Explain why, suggest alternatives

3. **If This Sprint:**
   - Move to [`inbox/active/`](../../active/)
   - Create Di√°taxis change request (Phase 3: DDD)
   - Update sprint intent document
   - Notify requesting repo

4. **If Next Sprint:**
   - Keep in `inbox/incoming/coordination/`
   - Add to project backlog
   - Set review date

5. **If Rejected:**
   - Move to rejected/ subfolder
   - Document rationale
   - Notify requesting repo

    "chora-base template updated to match spec"
  ],
  "dependencies": [
    "RFC 0001 (health monitoring) must be accepted and finalized",
    "chora-base v3.5.0 health endpoint template must exist"

## Creating a Coordination Request

### From Another Repo

If you're in `mcp-orchestration` and need something from `ecosystem-manifest`:

1. Create JSON file in your local repo's coordination tracking
2. Submit as PR or GitHub Issue to chora-base
3. File placed in `inbox/incoming/coordination/`
4. Reviewed in next sprint planning (every 2 weeks)

### From Strategic Planning

When strategic work (Phase 1) generates coordination needs:

1. Break down RFC into repo-specific work
2. Create coordination request for each cross-repo dependency
3. Link to original RFC
4. Schedule for sprint planning

---

## Status Tracking

Coordination requests move through these states:

```
inbox/incoming/coordination/  (pending review)
          ‚Üì sprint planning
          ‚Üì ACCEPTED FOR THIS SPRINT
inbox/active/                 (being worked)
          ‚Üì implementation complete
inbox/completed/              (delivered)
```

Track status by **file location**, not a status field.
