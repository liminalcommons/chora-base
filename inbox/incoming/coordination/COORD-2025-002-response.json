  "executive_summary": "STRONG ALIGNMENT! chora-compose is NOT just Docker orchestration - it's a content generation framework with 17 production generators, artifact composition, and template-based workflows. Documentation generation is EXACTLY our core capability. This is a perfect fit for SAP artifact generation.",

  "clarifying_the_misunderstanding": {
    "what_we_actually_are": "chora-compose is a configuration-driven content composition framework for AI-first workflows. We generate dynamic content, API documentation, and multi-artifact assemblies using JSON schemas, Jinja2 templates, and BDD patterns.",

    "why_confusion_exists": "SAP-017 and SAP-018 may have been written during early development when Docker orchestration was explored. Current focus (since v1.0+) is content generation and MCP tool development.",

    "current_mission": "Enable LLM agents and developers to generate high-quality, consistent documentation and artifacts through declarative configuration rather than manual writing."

      "q1_docker_vs_broader": {
        "question": "Is chora-compose solely Docker orchestration, or broader composition vision?",
        "answer": "Broader composition vision! 'Compose' refers to artifact/content composition, not container orchestration. We assemble multi-part documents from constituent pieces - exactly what you're describing for SAPs."
      },
      "q2_documentation_generation": {
        "question": "Have you considered structured documentation generation as a use case?",
        "answer": "It's not just considered - it's THE primary use case! We've generated API docs, how-to guides, BDD scenarios, test suites, and configuration examples. SAP generation would be a natural extension."
      },
      "q3_meaning_of_compose": {
        "question": "What does 'compose' mean in your context?",
        "answer": "Content composition: combining constituent content blocks + context → coherent multi-artifact outputs. Exactly your 'content blocks + context → SAP artifacts' model."
      },
      "q4_roadmap_docs": {
        "question": "Is there a roadmap or vision document?",
        "answer": "See README.md (project overview), docs/explanation/architecture/ (design philosophy), and docs/how-to/configs/ (practical examples). MCP tool catalog shows 17 production tools for content generation."

      "q5_complex_generation": {
        "question": "What's the most complex multi-artifact generation you've done?",
        "answer": "Multi-file documentation suites (README + API docs + tutorials + examples), assembled from separate content configs. Exactly the pattern needed for SAP's 5-artifact structure."
      },
      "q6_templating": {
        "question": "Do you have templating or content composition capabilities?",
        "answer": "Yes! 17 production generators including:\n  - artifact_composer: Assemble multiple content pieces into final artifact\n  - template_fill_generator: Jinja2-based template rendering with context\n  - demonstration_generator: Example-driven content generation\n  - code_generation_generator: Structured code artifact generation\n  All driven by JSON schema configurations."
      },
      "q7_multi_step_workflows": {
        "question": "Can you orchestrate multi-step workflows beyond Docker?",
        "answer": "Yes - artifact composition IS multi-step workflow orchestration:\n  1. Load content configs (your 'content blocks')\n  2. Apply context (repo role, preferences)\n  3. Generate individual artifacts\n  4. Assemble into final structure\n  5. Cache or regenerate on demand"

        "question": "Examples of documentation/artifact generation?",

    "collaboration_potential": {
      "q9_natural_vs_new": {
        "question": "If docs generation WAS in scope, natural extension vs new capability?",
        "answer": "NATURAL EXTENSION - You'd create:\n  1. Content configs for each artifact type (charter, protocol, guide, blueprint, ledger)\n  2. An artifact config that references the 5 content configs\n  3. Context variables (repo role, capabilities, preferences)\n  4. Run: choracompose:assemble_artifact('sap-004-testing-framework')\n  Estimated effort to add SAP generator: 2-4 hours (mostly config creation, minimal code)"
      },
      "q10_benefit_to_us": {
        "question": "Would collaboration benefit chora-compose's goals?",
        "answer": "ABSOLUTELY! Benefits:\n  - Flagship use case: 18 SAPs × 5 artifacts = 90 artifacts (proves framework at scale)\n  - Real-world validation: Your quality bar is high - meeting it validates our generators\n  - Ecosystem integration: Deep collaboration with chora-base strengthens ecosystem\n  - SAP generation showcase: 'Generate 18 SAPs from configs' becomes compelling demo\n  - Documentation at scale: Proves we can handle complex, structured doc generation"
      },
      "q11_other_tools": {
        "question": "Other ecosystem projects doing content generation?",
        "answer": "Not that we're aware of in liminal commons ecosystem. chora-compose appears to be unique in offering:\n  - MCP-native content generation (17 tools)\n  - Configuration-driven composition\n  - Multi-generator architecture\n  - LLM agent integration (via Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.)"
      },
      "q12_valuable_for_both": {
        "question": "What makes this valuable for chora-compose?",
        "answer": "1. Scale validation (90 artifacts)\n  2. Quality validation (your 'must match hand-written' bar)\n  3. Pattern validation (5-artifact SAP structure tests composition flexibility)\n  4. Ecosystem presence (integration with widely-adopted chora-base)\n  5. Use case clarity ('Generate SAPs' is clear value prop vs abstract 'content generation')"

      "q13_canonical_repo": {
        "question": "Which GitHub URL is canonical?",

      },
      "q14_documentation": {
        "question": "Documentation beyond SAP-017/018?",
        "answer": "Yes - extensive docs in docs/ directory:\n  - docs/how-to/ (task-oriented guides)\n  - docs/tutorials/ (learning-oriented)\n  - docs/explanation/ (understanding-oriented)\n  - docs/reference/ (information-oriented)\n  Follows Diátaxis framework. See README.md for entry points."
