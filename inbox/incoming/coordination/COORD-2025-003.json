  "priority": "P1",
  "urgency": "backlog",
  "deliverables": [
    "Technical review of React SAP architecture and content block structure",
    "Assessment of alignment with chora-base SAP standards and patterns",
    "Recommendations for improving clarity and accessibility",
    "Identification of potential gaps or edge cases in React patterns",
    "Feedback on reusability and scalability for ecosystem adoption"
  ],
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "Technical review compares React SAP structure against ≥3 established chora-base SAPs",
    "Alignment assessment provides specific examples of matches and deviations from standards",
    "Recommendations include ≥5 specific improvement suggestions with clear rationale",
    "Gap analysis identifies ≥3 areas requiring additional coverage or clarification",
    "Review feedback is constructive with specific examples and actionable next steps",
    "Assessment addresses both technical accuracy and documentation clarity"

  "context": {
    "background": "chora-workspace is developing a comprehensive set of React SAPs (Foundation, State Management, Styling, Testing, Performance, Linting) for ecosystem-wide adoption. These SAPs follow chora-base patterns but introduce React-specific content blocks and patterns. Before broader ecosystem release, we're requesting peer review from chora-base maintainers to ensure alignment with SAP standards, identify gaps, and gather recommendations for improvement.\n\nThis peer review aims to validate that React SAPs maintain the quality and consistency expected in the chora ecosystem while addressing React-specific needs effectively.",
    "rationale": "We considered three review approaches: (1) self-review only, (2) automated linting/validation, (3) peer review from chora-base experts. Self-review risks blind spots in SAP structure. Automated tools can't assess clarity or ecosystem fit. We chose peer review to leverage chora-base expertise, ensure ecosystem alignment, and gather constructive feedback before broader adoption.",
    "not_requesting": "We are NOT requesting complete rewrite of React SAPs. We are NOT asking for React implementation work or code examples. This review does NOT need to validate React technical patterns (we have React experts for that). We are NOT expecting immediate turnaround or blocking on this review."

  "trace_id": "react-sap-peer-review-2025",
  "estimated_effort": "8-12 hours",
  "questions": {
    "SAP Structure and Standards": [
      "Do React SAPs follow the established SAP format used in chora-base?",
      "Are content blocks appropriately decomposed and reusable?",
      "Does the documentation follow Diátaxis framework consistently?"
    ],
    "Ecosystem Alignment": [
      "How well do React SAPs integrate with existing chora-base patterns?",
      "Are there naming or terminology conflicts with established SAPs?",
      "Do the React SAPs enable smooth onboarding for chora-base contributors?"
    ],
    "Clarity and Accessibility": [
      "Are acronyms and React-specific terms defined clearly?",
      "Is the documentation accessible to developers with varying React experience?",
      "Are examples concrete and representative of real use cases?"
    ],
    "Gaps and Edge Cases": [
      "Are there React patterns or scenarios not covered by the current SAPs?",
      "Do the SAPs address common React pitfalls and anti-patterns?",
      "Are there edge cases in state management or performance that need more coverage?"
    ]
  },
  "collaboration_modes": [
    "Comprehensive Review: Detailed line-by-line review of all React SAPs with inline comments, architectural feedback, and examples. Estimated effort: 10-12 hours.",
    "Architectural Review: Focus on high-level SAP structure, content block design, and ecosystem alignment without detailed technical validation. Estimated effort: 6-8 hours.",
    "Quick Assessment: High-level scan for obvious misalignments or gaps with brief written feedback. Estimated effort: 2-3 hours."
