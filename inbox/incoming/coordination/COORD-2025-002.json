  "created": "2025-11-02",
  "context": {
    "background": "SAP-009 currently supports one-way translation from chora-specific delimiters to standard Jinja2 delimiters. Ecosystem feedback indicates strong need for bidirectional translation to enable agents to work with both chora-base templates and standard template libraries. This prescriptive request defines the complete implementation scope for SAP-009 v1.1.0, including specification updates, implementation, testing, documentation, and release.",
    "rationale": "We considered three approaches: (1) extend existing translate.py with reverse mode, (2) create separate bidirectional script, (3) implement as independent package. Extending existing script creates confusion about translation direction. Independent package adds maintenance overhead. We chose a new bidirectional script with clear direction flags, enabling explicit control and better error messages while maintaining backward compatibility with existing one-way translation workflows."
