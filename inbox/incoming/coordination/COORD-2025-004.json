    "background": "chora-base completed a 4-week pilot (Weeks 1-4) evaluating chora-compose for SAP-001 Inbox Coordination Protocol artifact generation. The pilot successfully validated the design approach, achieving 94.9% quality score (target: ≥80%) with complete validation infrastructure (post-processing scripts, quality evaluation, JSON schemas, BDD scenarios).\n\nWeek 5 investigation revealed: (1) chora-compose v1.9.1 is installed but CLI is not available, (2) archived documentation describes the architecture (ConfigLoader, ArtifactComposer) but appears to be implementation/development guides rather than user guides, (3) v1.9.0 release focuses on stigmergic context links and SAP regeneration rather than inbox artifact generation.\n\nWe designed 15 content configs and 1 artifact assembly config following patterns from chora-compose documentation. However, we need clarification on current production status and whether inbox artifact generation is a supported use case before proceeding with integration.",
    "rationale": "We have three paths forward: (A) integrate with chora-compose as-is by building from source, (B) build interim solution and migrate to chora-compose when production-ready, or (C) build standalone generator and preserve future migration path. Path A assumes chora-compose is ready for our use case. Path B assumes clear timeline exists. Path C assumes chora-compose timeline is uncertain or use case unsupported.\n\nWithout clarity on chora-compose status and roadmap, we risk either (1) building on an unstable foundation if we integrate prematurely, or (2) building redundant infrastructure if chora-compose will support our use case within 3-6 months. This coordination request aims to gather information needed to make an informed path decision.",
    "not_requesting": "We are NOT requesting chora-compose implement inbox artifact generation if it's not on the roadmap. We are NOT asking for priority treatment or urgent timeline changes. We are NOT expecting chora-compose to modify its architecture to fit our specific use case. This is purely exploratory to understand what's possible and what timeline to expect."

  "questions": {
    "Production Readiness": [
      "Is chora-compose v1.9.x considered production-ready for artifact generation use cases?",
      "Why is the CLI (`chora-compose` command) not available despite package installation?",
      "Are the archived user docs (ConfigLoader, ArtifactComposer API examples) accurate for v1.9.x?",
      "What's the recommended way to use chora-compose: CLI, Python API, or MCP server?"
    ],
    "Use Case Fit": [
      "Does chora-compose support generating artifacts from minimal context (5-10 input fields → 18-field JSON)?",
      "Is the primary focus SAP regeneration (stigmergic links, freshness tracking) or also new artifact creation?",
      "Can content configs specify AI-augmented generation (e.g., generate 200-400 word background from purpose field)?",
      "Are conditional field inclusion rules supported (e.g., include 'questions' only if request_type == 'exploratory')?"
    ],
    "Post-Processing Integration": [
      "Does chora-compose support post-generation hooks or plugins?",
      "Can we integrate custom post-processing (ID allocation from sequence files, event emission to JSONL)?",
      "Is there a validation framework for generated artifacts, or should we bring our own?",
      "How does chora-compose handle artifact promotion from draft to final directories?"
    ],
    "Timeline and Roadmap": [
      "What version will have production-ready CLI and artifact generation?",
      "Is there a target release date for production artifact generation features?",
      "Are there breaking changes expected between v1.9.x and v2.0?",
      "Would you recommend waiting for chora-compose or building interim solution now?"

  },
  "collaboration_modes": [
    "Deep Exploration: Joint session reviewing chora-compose architecture, walking through our pilot configs, and determining integration feasibility. Includes working code examples and testing. Estimated effort: 3-4 hours.",
    "Technical Consultation: Async discussion via GitHub issues or coordination channels addressing the questions above with specific guidance on API usage and roadmap. Estimated effort: 1.5-2 hours.",
    "Quick Assessment: Brief review of our use case with high-level recommendation (integrate now, wait for vX.X, or build standalone). Estimated effort: 30-60 minutes."
