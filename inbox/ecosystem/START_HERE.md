## 🎯 Why This Matters

### For Your Repository

**If you have cross-repo dependencies** → Full Onboarding unlocks:
- Dependency tracking (know when blockers resolve)
- Integration coordination (structured handoffs)
- Event traceability (debug across repos in minutes)

**If you want visibility** → Capability Only gives you:
- Dashboard presence (all repos see your status)
- Blocker communication (signal what's blocking you)
- Easy upgrade (expand to full onboarding anytime)

**If you're unsure** → Observer Mode lets you:
- Watch coordination in action
- See how other repos benefit
- Decide later with zero commitment

### For the Ecosystem

**W3 Health Monitoring** (if approved) needs coordination across 4 repos:
- Week 3-4: chora-base + ecosystem-manifest (parallel work)
- Week 5-8: mcp-orchestration (depends on Week 3-4)
- Week 9-12: mcp-gateway (depends on Week 5-8)
- Week 13-16: Production deployment (coordinated sequence)

**Without coordination**: Email threads, unclear dependencies, integration surprises

**With coordination**: Dashboard visibility, event tracing, structured handoffs (47 events logged in example)
