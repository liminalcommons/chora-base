# Deferred Proposals

**Status:** Not accepted for current roadmap
**Purpose:** Preserve ideas for future consideration
**Review:** Next quarterly planning session

---

## Purpose

This directory contains strategic proposals that were **deferred** or **rejected** during quarterly review, along with the rationale for why they weren't accepted.

## Why Defer/Reject?

Common reasons:
- ‚è∞ **Timing** - Good idea, wrong time (capacity, priorities)
- üéØ **Alignment** - Doesn't align with current strategic direction
- üî¨ **Needs Research** - Requires more investigation before deciding
- üí∞ **ROI** - Benefit doesn't justify effort at this time
- üö´ **Out of Scope** - Better suited for different project/ecosystem

---

## Format

When moving a proposal to deferred/, add a frontmatter section with decision metadata:

```markdown
---
title: Original Proposal Title
type: strategic-proposal
created: YYYY-MM-DD
reviewed: YYYY-MM-DD
status: deferred | rejected
decision: |
  Brief explanation of why this was deferred or rejected.
  What would need to change for us to reconsider?
next_review: YYYY-MM-DD (for deferred items)
decision_makers: [List of people who made decision]

## Example

```markdown
---
title: Implement Real-Time Collaboration Features
type: strategic-proposal
created: 2025-10-15
reviewed: 2025-10-27
status: deferred
decision: |
  Deferred to Q2 2026. While real-time collaboration would be valuable,
  we need to complete W3 health monitoring first (current priority).
  Additionally, this would require websocket infrastructure we don't
  have yet. Revisit after W3 is stable.

## Review Process

Deferred proposals are reviewed:
- **Quarterly** - During strategic planning sessions
- **On Request** - If circumstances change (e.g., new requirements, capacity opens up)

### Decision Matrix

| Status | Meaning | Next Review | Action |
|--------|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Deferred (Timing)** | Good idea, wrong time | Next quarter | Move back to proposals/ for re-review |
| **Deferred (Research)** | Needs investigation | After research complete | Create research task |
| **Rejected (Alignment)** | Doesn't fit direction | Not scheduled | Keep for historical reference |
| **Rejected (Out of Scope)** | Wrong project | Not scheduled | Suggest alternative home |

## Resurrection Process

To resurrect a deferred proposal:
1. Check if circumstances have changed
2. Update proposal with new context
3. Move back to [`inbox/ecosystem/proposals/`](../proposals/)
4. Mark as "revised" in frontmatter
5. Include in next quarterly review
