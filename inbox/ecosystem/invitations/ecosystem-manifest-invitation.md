# Invitation: ecosystem-manifest → chora-workspace

**To**: ecosystem-manifest Repository Stewards & Contributors
**From**: chora-workspace (Distributed Development Coordination Hub)
**Date**: 2025-10-31
**Subject**: Be Our First External Adopter - Shape the Coordination Standard

---

## Why We're Reaching Out to You First

**ecosystem-manifest** is uniquely positioned as the **standards authority** for the Liminal Commons ecosystem. You define:
- Server registry format and quality standards
- Health check specifications
- Ecosystem-wide conventions

**Our invitation**: Be the **first external repository** to adopt the inbox coordination protocol, helping us validate and refine it before broader ecosystem rollout.

---

## What ecosystem-manifest Gains

### 1. Coordination Visibility Across All Consumers

**Your challenge**: Standards you define get consumed by multiple repos (chora-base, mcp-orchestration, mcp-gateway). How do you track adoption, compliance, and feedback?

**What we offer**:
- **Capability registry**: See which repos consume which standards
- **Event traceability**: Track when standards are adopted, questions arise, issues found
- **Ecosystem dashboard**: Real-time view of who's using what version

**Example from W3**:
```yaml
# ecosystem-manifest declares
provides:
  - capability: server_registry
    version: v1.0.0
    schema: registry.schema.json

  - capability: health_check_spec
    version: v1.0.0
    standard: health-check-format-adr-0001

# Other repos declare consumption
chora-base:
  consumes:
    - capability: server_registry
      from_repo: ecosystem-manifest
      version: ">=1.0.0"

mcp-orchestration:
  consumes:
    - capability: health_check_spec
      from_repo: ecosystem-manifest
      version: ">=1.0.0"
```

**Value**: One file (`ECOSYSTEM_STATUS.yaml`) shows you every consumer, their version requirements, blockers.

### 2. Standards Validation Through Actual Usage

**Your challenge**: How do you know if your standards work in practice? Do they reduce friction or create it?

**What we offer**:
- **Event logs**: See when repos struggle with standards (questions, errors, workarounds)
- **Knowledge notes**: Capture patterns of successful adoption
- **ROI metrics**: Measure time saved (or wasted) by standards

**Example pattern**:
1. You publish health check standard (ADR 0001)
2. mcp-orchestration implements it, logs events
3. Events show: 2 hours spent on ambiguous requirement in spec
4. Knowledge note created: "Health check format clarity improvements needed"
5. You release v1.1 with clarification
6. Next implementation (mcp-gateway): 0.5 hours, no questions
7. **Measured improvement**: 75% time reduction from standard iteration

**Value**: Evidence-based standard evolution, not guessing what works.

### 3. Dependency Coordination

**Your challenge**: W3 Health Monitoring requires coordinated work across 4 repos, with ecosystem-manifest being a dependency for others.

**What we offer**:
- **Dependency tracking**: Clear visibility of who's blocked waiting for what
- **Timeline coordination**: See when your releases need to align with others
- **Integration planning**: Coordinate testing across consumer repos

**W3 Timeline Example**:
```
Week 3-4: ecosystem-manifest creates server registry (coord-002)
  ↓ (blocks)
Week 5-8: mcp-orchestration implements health monitoring (coord-003)
  ↓ (enables)
Week 9-12: Integration testing across mcp-orchestration + mcp-gateway
  ↓ (validates)
Week 13-16: Production rollout with coordinated releases
```

**Events logged**: 47 events with trace ID `ecosystem-w3-health-monitoring` showing complete dependency chain.

**Value**: No surprises - you know who's blocked, who's ready, when to release.

### 4. Shape the Coordination Standard

**Your opportunity**: As **first external adopter**, you influence inbox protocol evolution:
- Test coordination request schema with real needs
- Validate capability declaration format
- Identify gaps before broader rollout
- Your feedback shapes v2.0 of protocol

**Your contribution**: Working example of standards authority using inbox protocol to coordinate consumers.

## Success Pattern for Your First Coordination Request

When you're ready to coordinate work (e.g., W3 Health Monitoring server registry):

### ✅ DO: Provide Quantitative Impact Data

**Example**:
```json
{
  "deliverable": "Server registry with 12 initial MCP servers",
  "impact": "Enables mcp-orchestration auto-discovery (eliminates 15-20 min manual configuration per deployment)"
}
```

### ✅ DO: Offer Working Prototypes

**Example**:
```json
{
  "contribution": "Draft registry.schema.json (150 lines, validates 3 sample servers)",
  "value": "Accelerates schema review by ~60% (ready for feedback vs starting from scratch)"
}
```

### ✅ DO: Connect to Ecosystem Strategy

**Example**:
```json
{
  "strategic_alignment": "Supports v4.x objective: Improve ecosystem growth and adoption",
  "ecosystem_value": "Single source of truth reduces onboarding friction for new server authors"
}
```

### ✅ DO: Define Clear Success Criteria

**Example**:
```json
{
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "Registry includes ≥10 validated MCP servers",
    "Schema validation passes for all entries",
    "Documentation includes onboarding guide for new server authors",
    "Integration test with mcp-orchestration succeeds (auto-discovery works)"
  ]
}
```

**Result from COORD-003**: 70% acceptance rate, 0.5 hour response time, 50% acceleration through contributions.

## W3 Health Monitoring: Your Role

If the ecosystem pursues W3 Health Monitoring, ecosystem-manifest is **critical path**:

### Week 3-4: Your Deliverable (coord-002)

**Request**: Create server registry with health check specifications

**Deliverables**:
1. `registry.yaml` - Canonical server registry (12+ servers)
2. `registry.schema.json` - Validation schema
3. `health-check-spec.md` - Health check format specification (per ADR-0001)
4. `docs/onboarding-guide.md` - How new servers register

**Dependencies**:
- **From chora-base**: Template for registry structure (coord-001, Week 3)
- **Provides to mcp-orchestration**: Registry for auto-discovery (coord-003, Week 5)

**Timeline**: 2 weeks (Weeks 3-4)

**Events to log**:
- `registry_created`, `schema_validated`, `health_spec_published`, `documentation_complete`
- All with `trace_id: "ecosystem-w3-health-monitoring"`

**Coordination**: We'll help track dependencies, signal when chora-base deliverable is ready, coordinate testing with mcp-orchestration.

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Full Onboarding (Recommended)

1. **Review pre-filled capability template** (5 min)
2. **Adjust as needed** and submit to us (10 min)
3. **Create inbox/ structure** in ecosystem-manifest when repo is created (30 min)
4. **Join weekly ecosystem broadcast** (Sundays, 10 min/week)

**Timeline**: 45 min initial + 10 min/week ongoing

**Value**: Full ecosystem visibility, coordination support, shape protocol evolution

### Option 2: Lightweight Participation

1. **Register capabilities only** using pre-filled template (15 min)
2. **Receive ecosystem dashboard updates** (read-only, no inbox adoption)
3. **Evaluate after observing** coordination in action

**Timeline**: 15 min one-time

**Value**: Ecosystem visibility, low commitment, can expand later

### Option 3: Observer Mode

1. **Review weekly broadcasts** (Sundays, 10 min/week)
2. **Watch W3 coordination** if it proceeds
3. **Decide later** based on observed value

**Timeline**: 10 min/week, no commitment

**Value**: Stay informed, zero setup effort

## Why This Matters

### For ecosystem-manifest

You're the **standards authority**. The coordination workspace helps you:
- **Validate standards** through measured usage (not assumptions)
- **Coordinate consumers** without manual tracking
- **Evolve standards** based on evidence (event logs, knowledge notes, metrics)

### For the Ecosystem

ecosystem-manifest adopting inbox protocol **signals to other repos** that:
- Standards authority trusts this coordination approach
- Cross-repo coordination is ecosystem-endorsed
- First external validation completed (you've tested and approved)

Your participation **makes it easier** for mcp-orchestration, mcp-gateway, and future repos to adopt.

### For You Personally

**Learning opportunity**: See how coordination protocol works from standards authority perspective, inform your own standard-setting work.

**Evidence for your work**: Quantitative data on standard adoption, usage patterns, friction points - not anecdotes.
