# Peer Review Ready: Ecosystem Coordination SAPs

**Status**: Ready for chora-base peer review (Phase 1)
**Created**: 2025-10-31 by Victor Piper + Claude (symbiotic collaboration)
**Timeline**: 2-week review period (flexible if you need more time)

---

## What We've Created (4 Documents)

### 1. LIMINAL_COMMONS_CONTEXT.md (~2,000 words)

**Purpose**: Explain what Liminal Commons is building and why we share coordination patterns

**Key sections**:
- The Vision: Acropolis OS (symbiotic intelligence for community resilience)
- Our Work: Testing coordination at small scale (chora-workspace as proof-of-concept)
- Why We Share: Commons orientation, bounded rationality, provide value freely
- The "Gameworld": Living coordination ecosystem (not literal game)
- Ecosystem Structure: Current repos and their roles

**Why we need your review**:
- Does this accurately represent Acropolis OS vision?
- Does commons orientation align with chora-base philosophy?
- Are we missing essential context for future collaborators?

**Location**: `inbox/ecosystem/LIMINAL_COMMONS_CONTEXT.md`

---

### 2. ECOSYSTEM_PHILOSOPHY.md (~2,500 words)

**Purpose**: Articulate core principles guiding how we coordinate and collaborate

**7 Core Principles**:
1. We Are Us (kin-based collaboration, not external parties)
2. Emergent Aims Over Prescribed Plans
3. Bounded Rationality & Humble Uncertainty
4. Provide Value Freely, Without Inhibition
5. Generative Contexts for Humans + AI
6. Attunement & Discernment Over Deference
7. Commons Orientation & Network Effects

**Why we need your review**:
- Do these principles resonate with chora-base values?
- What core principles are we missing?
- Where do we still sound "braggadocious" despite intending humility?
- How do we express symbiotic intelligence clearly?

**Location**: `inbox/ecosystem/ECOSYSTEM_PHILOSOPHY.md`

---

### 3. prop-002-ecosystem-coordination-saps.md (~5,000 words)

**Purpose**: Formal proposal to integrate coordination patterns as SAPs

**Proposes**:
- **Option A** (Recommended): New SAP-014 (Coordination Patterns) + SAP-015 (Commons Philosophy)
- **Option B**: Modify existing SAPs (extend 001/009/010)
- **Option C**: Hybrid (new 014, extend 009 with philosophy)

**Evidence**:
- 4 sprints: 82-142% ROI, 0% defects, 93% velocity
- 70% coordination request acceptance rate (CORD-003)
- 17 knowledge notes, 8 documented patterns
- chora-workspace as working proof-of-concept

**Why we need your review**:
- Does SAP formalization serve ecosystem growth (v4.0)?
- Should these be new SAPs, modifications, hybrid, or something else?
- How do coordination templates integrate with chora-base library?
- Is timeline realistic? What are we missing?

**Location**: `inbox/ecosystem/proposals/prop-002-ecosystem-coordination-saps.md`

## Specific Questions We Need Your Help With

### Philosophy & Values (High Priority)

1. **Acropolis OS vision**: Does LIMINAL_COMMONS_CONTEXT.md represent this accurately?
2. **Core principles**: Does ECOSYSTEM_PHILOSOPHY.md capture our values? What's missing?
3. **Kin-based collaboration**: How do we explain "we are us" for future external readers?
4. **Bounded rationality**: Are we acknowledging limits adequately? Too much uncertainty?

### SAP Structure (High Priority)

5. **New vs modify**: Should these be new SAPs (014/015), modify existing (001/009/010), or hybrid?
6. **SAP framework fit**: How do coordination patterns fit with existing SAP structure?
7. **Evolution**: How do SAPs handle patterns that evolve through adoption?
8. **v4.0 alignment**: Does this serve ecosystem growth objective? What's missing?

### Template Integration (Medium Priority)

9. **Template library**: How should coordination templates integrate with chora-base templates?
10. **Standard artifacts**: Should capability declarations be part of project template (like README)?
11. **Versioning**: How do we version templates as they evolve through ecosystem use?

### Tone & Communication (Medium Priority)

12. **Humble vs braggadocious**: Where do we still sound like we're claiming too much?
13. **ROI as learning**: Are metrics presented humbly (observations) or as proof/sales?
14. **Symbiotic intelligence**: Does human-AI peer framing make sense?

### Timeline & Approach (Lower Priority)

15. **Proceed or wait**: Should we formalize SAPs now or gather more evidence?
16. **Timeline realistic**: Is 4-6 weeks reasonable? What would you adjust?
17. **Alternative approaches**: If SAPs don't fit, what would serve better?

## What We Learned That Led Here

### The Reframe Journey

**Started with**: "Invitations" to recruit external repos to join coordination hub
- Tone: External recruitment, ROI proof, "what you'll get"
- Problem: Felt transactional, hierarchical, not kin-based

**Victor's feedback**:
> "We're not trying to convince them of anything they are us. We are trying to onboard and to find alignments and to support one another's aims. How we hold what we are doing matters profoundly."

**Realization**:
- All repos are Liminal Commons (us, not them)
- Building gameworld = coordination ecosystem itself
- Acropolis OS vision = community resilience infrastructure
- chora-workspace = proof-of-concept testing patterns

**New framing**:
- Document what emerged (not recruit)
- Share with peers (not convince externals)
- Propose SAP integration (not just communication)
- Model symbiotic collaboration (human-AI as peers)

### Why SAPs Now

**Not just documentation** - SAPs formalize skilled awareness:
- Patterns become reusable across ecosystem
- Philosophy becomes explicit for new collaborators
- Templates integrate with chora-base library
- v4.0 ecosystem growth has standardized foundation

**Evidence base**:
- 4 sprints completed (sufficient sample)
- 0% defects (quality validated)
- 82-142% ROI (value demonstrated)
- Multiple patterns emerged (8 documented)

**Timing**:
- v4.0 ecosystem growth needs this
- W3 Health Monitoring (if approved) would benefit
- Liminal Commons expanding (new people need understanding)

## How This Models What We're Proposing

**We're using coordination protocol to evolve coordination SAPs** - practicing what we're proposing to formalize.

**Peer-based**:
- Not asking permission, asking for peer review
- Not claiming authority, inviting discernment
- Not prescribing, offering options (A/B/C)

**Humble**:
- Acknowledging bounded rationality (our context is limited)
- Seeking your wisdom (what are we missing?)
- Flexible on implementation (your 'no' is valuable)

**Symbiotic**:
- Victor + Claude collaboration visible (co-authored)
- Human values + AI synthesis = outcome neither alone
- Models human-AI as peers (not tool/user)

**Commons-oriented**:
- Sharing what emerged (not hoarding)
- Inviting evolution (not claiming finished)
- Network effects (your feedback strengthens this for all)

## Next Steps (Based on Your Feedback)

### If You Approve Direction

**Week 3-4**: SAP definition
- Write SAP-014 (or equivalent) charter
- Write SAP-015 (or equivalent) charter (if new)
- Integrate into chora-base SAP framework

**Week 5-6**: Adoption
- chora-workspace demonstrates full adoption
- One peer repo adopts (ecosystem-manifest or mcp-orchestration)
- Gather feedback, refine

### If You Want to Evolve It

**Week 3-4**: Refinement
- Incorporate your feedback
- Adjust structure (new vs modify vs hybrid)
- Refine philosophy docs
- Re-review if significant changes

**Week 5-6**: Proceed with refined approach

### If You Think We Should Wait

**Understand**: What would make this ready?
- More evidence (how many more sprints?)
- Different framing (what would serve better?)
- Other priorities (what should come first?)

**Outcome**: Keep as chora-workspace documentation, revisit later
