# START HERE: Ecosystem Coordination Patterns

**Context**: chora-workspace evolved coordination patterns over 4 sprints. This is peer documentation - take what serves.

**Quick navigation**: 3 minutes to understand what emerged and whether it might serve your context.

---

## ⚡ Quick Answer: What Is This?

chora-workspace tested distributed development coordination patterns across liminal commons ecosystem repositories.

**What emerged**: Inbox protocol, event traceability, self-improving feedback loops, capability-based routing

**For peer repos**: Explore patterns, adopt what serves your context, discard what doesn't

**Current status**: SAP proposal under peer review (2-week period, flexible)

---

## 📋 Navigation: What To Read

### If You Want Quick Overview (10 min)

**Start here**:
- [ECOSYSTEM_COORDINATION_PATTERNS.md](ECOSYSTEM_COORDINATION_PATTERNS.md) - What emerged from our 4 sprints

**Look for**:
- ✅ Patterns that emerged (inbox protocol, event traceability, feedback loops)
- ✅ ROI we observed in our context (82-142%, yours will differ)
- ✅ If any patterns resonate with your coordination challenges

### If You Want Philosophy Context (10 min)

**Read these**:
- [ECOSYSTEM_PHILOSOPHY.md](ECOSYSTEM_PHILOSOPHY.md) - 7 core principles (kin-based, bounded rationality, etc.)
- [LIMINAL_COMMONS_CONTEXT.md](LIMINAL_COMMONS_CONTEXT.md) - Acropolis OS vision, why we share patterns

**Look for**:
- ✅ Do principles resonate? (commons-oriented, symbiotic intelligence)
- ✅ Does vision align with your aims?

### If You Want Formal Proposal (20 min)

**For peer review**:
- [proposals/prop-002-ecosystem-coordination-saps.md](proposals/prop-002-ecosystem-coordination-saps.md) - SAP proposal for formalizing patterns
- [PEER_REVIEW_READY.md](PEER_REVIEW_READY.md) - What's under review, how to engage

**Look for**:
- ✅ Should these become formal SAPs in chora-base?
- ✅ What would need to change to serve ecosystem?
- ✅ Feedback welcome in 2-week peer review period (flexible)

## 🆘 Need More Info?

### "What patterns emerged?"

**Read**: [ECOSYSTEM_COORDINATION_PATTERNS.md](ECOSYSTEM_COORDINATION_PATTERNS.md)

**TL;DR**:
- Inbox protocol (3-level intake) - 70% acceptance in our context
- Event traceability (CHORA_TRACE_ID) - W3 shows 47-event coordination
- Self-improving feedback loops - 82-142% ROI we observed (yours will differ)
- Git-native, no external dependencies

### "How would I explore these patterns?"

**Read**: [ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md](ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md)

**TL;DR**:
1. Capability declaration (~15 min if useful)
2. Inbox protocol adoption (~30 min if serves)
3. Coordination as needed (optional)

### "What's the complete documentation map?"

**Read**: [README.md](README.md) (in this directory)

**TL;DR**: Complete navigation of all ecosystem documentation, what's where, how to triage.

### "I have questions or feedback"

**Engage**:
- GitHub Issues: chora-workspace repository
- Coordination request: Use `inbox/coordination/` if formal
- Peer review: Comment on prop-002 SAP proposal

**Response**: Async, peer-to-peer basis

## 🎯 Context: Why We Share This

### For Peer Repositories

**If you experience cross-repo coordination friction**:
- Dependency tracking patterns emerged (trace ID correlation)
- Integration coordination patterns (structured handoffs)
- Event traceability (complete audit trail)

**If you want ecosystem visibility**:
- Capability declaration pattern (what you provide/consume)
- Dashboard presence (status visible to peers)
- Blocker signaling (communicate blocks transparently)

**If you're exploring**:
- Documentation freely available
- Adopt what serves, discard what doesn't
- No commitment required to read/learn

### For Liminal Commons Ecosystem

**W3 Health Monitoring** (planned) would test these patterns:
- Week 3-4: chora-base + ecosystem-manifest (parallel work)
- Week 5-8: mcp-orchestration (depends on Week 3-4)
- Week 9-12: mcp-gateway (depends on Week 5-8)
- Week 13-16: Production deployment (coordinated sequence)

**Coordination challenges**: Dependency management, integration timing, deployment sequencing

**Patterns that might serve**: Event tracing (47 events logged in W3 example), capability-based routing, inbox protocol

**Bounded rationality**: W3 is aspirational, not yet executed. Real complexity will differ.

## ✅ Suggested Exploration Path

**If patterns resonate**:

- [ ] Read [ECOSYSTEM_COORDINATION_PATTERNS.md](ECOSYSTEM_COORDINATION_PATTERNS.md) (10 min)
- [ ] Read [ECOSYSTEM_PHILOSOPHY.md](ECOSYSTEM_PHILOSOPHY.md) if principles interest you (10 min)
- [ ] Review [prop-002](proposals/prop-002-ecosystem-coordination-saps.md) if you want to engage in SAP peer review (20 min)
- [ ] Explore capability declaration if visibility serves (15 min) → [CAPABILITIES templates](../coordination/CAPABILITIES/)

**If you want to try patterns**:

- [ ] Follow [ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md](ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md) for inbox protocol adoption
- [ ] Declare capabilities if ecosystem visibility useful
- [ ] Submit coordination request if you have cross-repo work

**No timeline pressure**: Peer review period is flexible, patterns available for exploration anytime.

## 💡 Common Questions

### "Is this something we should adopt?"

**Depends on your context.** If you experience cross-repo coordination friction, patterns might serve. If not, they might not be useful.

### "Can we use parts but not all?"

**Yes.** Capability declaration separate from inbox protocol. Event traceability separate from both. Take what serves.

### "What if patterns don't fit our repo?"

**Adapt or discard.** Templates are starting points, not requirements. Your context shapes what serves.

### "Are these formal standards now?"

**Not yet.** Under peer review as SAP proposal (prop-002). May become SAP-014/015 if affirmed, may change based on feedback, or may stay as informal patterns.

### "How much ongoing commitment?"

**Whatever serves you**:
- Capability declaration: One-time (~15 min), update as changes
- Inbox protocol: Adopt once (~30 min), use as needed
- Coordination: Only when you have cross-repo work

## 🚀 Next Steps

**Suggested flow**:

1. **Now**: Skim [ECOSYSTEM_COORDINATION_PATTERNS.md](ECOSYSTEM_COORDINATION_PATTERNS.md) (3 min)
2. **If interesting**: Read full patterns document (10 min)
3. **If resonates**: Read philosophy ([ECOSYSTEM_PHILOSOPHY.md](ECOSYSTEM_PHILOSOPHY.md)) and context ([LIMINAL_COMMONS_CONTEXT.md](LIMINAL_COMMONS_CONTEXT.md))
4. **If aligns**: Explore adoption ([ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md](ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md)) or peer review ([prop-002](proposals/prop-002-ecosystem-coordination-saps.md))

**No required actions**: This is peer learning documentation, not recruitment.

**Questions?** GitHub issues in chora-workspace or coordination request via inbox protocol
