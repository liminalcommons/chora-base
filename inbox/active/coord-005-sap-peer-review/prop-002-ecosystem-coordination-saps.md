# Proposal 002: Ecosystem Coordination SAPs

**Status**: Draft for peer review
**Author**: Victor Piper + Claude (symbiotic collaboration)
**Created**: 2025-10-31
**Affected Repositories**: chora-base (SAP definitions), chora-workspace (implementation), all ecosystem repos (adoption)
**Estimated Timeline**: 4-6 weeks (design → implementation → documentation)

---

## Executive Summary

**Problem**: We've evolved coordination patterns over 4 sprints (82-142% ROI, 0% defects, 93% velocity) but they're not integrated into our SAP (Skilled Awareness Package) framework.

**Solution**: Propose new SAPs (or modifications to existing SAPs) that formalize ecosystem coordination as skilled awareness, not just documentation.

**Impact**: Enables all repos to adopt proven coordination patterns as reusable skills, accelerates ecosystem growth objective (v4.0), models symbiotic human-AI collaboration.

---

## Problem Statement

### Current State

**What we've built** (in chora-workspace over 4 sprints):
- Inbox protocol implementation (SAP-001 adopted)
- Memory system with feedback loops (SAP-010 A-MEM)
- Metrics tracking and ROI analysis (SAP-013)
- Agent awareness with progressive context loading (SAP-009)
- Knowledge accumulation (17 notes, 8 patterns documented)

**What's missing**:
1. **No formalization as SAPs** - Coordination patterns exist as documentation, not as skilled awareness packages
2. **No integration with chora-base** - Patterns evolved in chora-workspace but not propagated to template/framework
3. **No reusability path** - Other repos can't easily adopt these patterns as standardized skills
4. **No philosophy SAP** - Core principles (kin-based collaboration, bounded rationality, symbiotic intelligence) not formalized

### Why This Matters Now

**v4.0 ecosystem growth objective** (from chora-base):
- Need standardized way for repos to coordinate
- Templates should embody coordination philosophy, not just technical patterns
- SAPs should enable ecosystem health, not just repo-level capabilities

**W3 Health Monitoring** (if approved):
- Requires 4 repos coordinating over 16 weeks
- Would benefit from standardized coordination SAPs
- Could validate SAP approach at ecosystem scale

**Liminal Commons expansion**:
- Victor + friend → more collaborators soon
- New people need to understand HOW we work, not just WHAT we've built
- Philosophy and patterns should be explicit, not implicit

---

## Proposed Solution

### Option A: New SAPs (Recommended)

Create 2-3 new SAPs that formalize what we've learned:

#### SAP-014: Ecosystem Coordination Patterns

**Purpose**: Skilled awareness for coordinating across repos in commons-oriented ecosystems

**Core skills**:
1. **Capability-based routing** - Declare what repos provide/consume, route requests appropriately
2. **Event-driven traceability** - Use trace IDs to correlate work across repos
3. **Progressive coordination** - 3-level intake (strategic/coordination/implementation)
4. **Humble communication** - Offer patterns without prescription, invite discernment
5. **ROI as learning** - Measure to understand what emerged, not to prove value

**Artifacts**:
- Capability declaration template (YAML)
- Coordination request schema (JSON)
- Event logging patterns (JSONL with trace IDs)
- Communication templates (peer learning tone)
- Decision trees (where does content go?)

**Evidence**:
- 70% acceptance rate (COORD-003)
- 82-142% ROI over 4 sprints
- 0% defects across 49 deliverables
- 93% average velocity

**Adoption path**:
- Read: ecosystem coordination documentation
- Practice: Create capability declaration for your repo
- Implement: Adopt inbox protocol, start logging events
- Evolve: Refine patterns based on your context

#### SAP-015: Commons Philosophy & Symbiotic Intelligence

**Purpose**: Skilled awareness for kin-based collaboration and human-AI partnership

**Core skills**:
1. **Kin-based collaboration** - Treat all ecosystem repos as us (peer, not external)
2. **Bounded rationality** - Acknowledge limits, communicate with humility
3. **Emergent aims** - Discover what serves through practice, not prescribe top-down
4. **Provide value freely** - Share wherever/whoever/however, without inhibition
5. **Symbiotic intelligence** - Humans + AI as peers (augment, not replace)
6. **Generative contexts** - Create conditions for mutual flourishing

**Artifacts**:
- Philosophy documentation (LIMINAL_COMMONS_CONTEXT.md, ECOSYSTEM_PHILOSOPHY.md)
- Communication tone guide (humble, peer, invitational)
- Symbiotic collaboration examples (human-AI co-authorship patterns)
- Discernment practices (how to evaluate what serves your context)

**Evidence**:
- 4 sprints of symbiotic human-AI collaboration (this work)
- Philosophy emerged from practice (documented post-hoc, not prescribed pre-hoc)
- Tone reframe from "recruitment" to "peer learning" (based on values clarification)

**Adoption path**:
- Read: Philosophy and context docs
- Reflect: Does this resonate with your values? What would you evolve?
- Practice: Apply principles to your coordination communication
- Contribute: Share your context-specific evolution of philosophy

### Option B: Modify Existing SAPs

Extend existing SAPs rather than create new ones:

#### Modify SAP-001 (Inbox Protocol)

**Add**:
- Ecosystem coordination patterns (capability-based routing, event traceability)
- Peer learning communication templates (not just request schemas)
- Philosophy integration (how inbox protocol embodies commons values)

#### Modify SAP-009 (Agent Awareness)

**Add**:
- Symbiotic intelligence principles (human-AI as peers)
- Progressive context loading for ecosystem coordination
- Humble communication patterns (acknowledge bounded rationality)

#### Modify SAP-010 (A-MEM Memory System)

**Add**:
- Cross-repo event correlation patterns
- Knowledge notes as ecosystem learning (not just repo-level)
- Feedback loops at ecosystem scale (Memory → Metrics → Awareness across repos)

### Option C: Hybrid Approach

**New SAP-014**: Ecosystem Coordination Patterns (technical)
**Extend SAP-009**: Add philosophy/symbiotic intelligence to Agent Awareness (conceptual)

---

## What We're Proposing to chora-base

**Not**: "Accept our patterns as-is"
**Not**: "We have the right approach"
**Not**: "Implement these SAPs because we say so"

**Instead**: "Here's what emerged from our 4-sprint experimentation. Does integrating these as SAPs serve the ecosystem? What would you evolve?"

**Specifically seeking**:
1. **Philosophy alignment**: Do LIMINAL_COMMONS_CONTEXT and ECOSYSTEM_PHILOSOPHY resonate with chora-base's understanding?
2. **SAP structure**: Should these be new SAPs, modifications to existing, or something else?
3. **Template integration**: How should coordination templates relate to chora-base's template library?
4. **v4.0 fit**: Does this serve ecosystem growth objective? What's missing?
5. **Tone guidance**: Where do our communications still sound "recruiting" vs "peer learning"?

## Affected Repositories

### chora-base (Most Critical)

**Why**: Defines SAP framework, provides templates, embodies ecosystem philosophy

**Changes needed**:
- Define new SAPs (or modify existing)
- Integrate coordination templates into template library
- Document philosophy in SAP awareness guides
- Update v4.0 roadmap to include ecosystem coordination

**Estimated effort**: 8-12 days
- SAP definition: 3-4 days
- Template integration: 2-3 days
- Documentation: 2-3 days
- Review/refinement: 1-2 days

### chora-workspace

**Why**: Implementation example, proof-of-concept, living documentation

**Changes needed**:
- Align existing patterns with final SAP definitions
- Add SAP adoption documentation
- Create SAP learning artifacts (examples, tutorials)
- Continue evolving patterns through practice

**Estimated effort**: 4-6 days
- Alignment: 1-2 days
- Documentation: 2-3 days
- Learning artifacts: 1-2 days

### ecosystem-manifest, mcp-orchestration, mcp-gateway

**Why**: Peer repos that could adopt SAPs

**Changes needed** (if they choose):
- Adopt SAP-014 (Ecosystem Coordination Patterns)
- Consider SAP-015 (Commons Philosophy) for communication tone
- Register capabilities, adopt inbox protocol

**Estimated effort**: 1-2 days per repo (if adopting)
- Capability declaration: 2-4 hours
- Inbox protocol adoption: 4-8 hours
- First coordination request: 2-4 hours

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Keep as Documentation Only

**Approach**: Don't formalize as SAPs, just document patterns in chora-workspace

**Pros**: Faster, less overhead, informal evolution
**Cons**: Not reusable by other repos, not integrated with chora-base, misses v4.0 opportunity

**Why rejected**: SAPs are how we share skilled awareness across ecosystem. Documentation alone doesn't enable adoption.

### Alternative 2: Wait for More Evidence

**Approach**: Run more sprints, gather more data before proposing SAPs

**Pros**: More confidence in patterns, larger sample size
**Cons**: Delays ecosystem growth, W3 might proceed without standardized coordination

**Why rejected**: 4 sprints with 0% defects and 82-142% ROI is sufficient evidence. Patterns will evolve through adoption anyway.

### Alternative 3: External Coordination Platform

**Approach**: Use existing tools (Jira, Linear, Asana) instead of Git-native SAPs

**Pros**: Established tools, familiar UX, existing integrations
**Cons**: External dependencies, not commons-oriented, data silos, subscription costs

**Why rejected**: Git-native aligns with our philosophy (transparency, no lock-in, owned infrastructure).

### Phase 2: SAP Definition (Week 3-4)

**Week 3**:
- Write SAP-014 (or equivalent) definition
- Write SAP-015 (or equivalent) definition (if new)
- Create awareness guides for each SAP

**Week 4**:
- chora-base integrates into SAP framework
- chora-workspace aligns implementation with final SAP definitions
- Documentation review

### Phase 3: Adoption (Week 5-6)

**Week 5**:
- chora-workspace demonstrates full SAP adoption
- One peer repo (ecosystem-manifest or mcp-orchestration) adopts
- Gather early feedback

**Week 6**:
- Refine based on adoption experience
- Document common questions/challenges
- Prepare for broader adoption (if W3 proceeds)

## Risk Assessment

### Risk: Philosophy Doesn't Resonate

**Likelihood**: Low-Medium (close collaboration with chora-base)
**Impact**: High (philosophy is foundational)
**Mitigation**: Peer review upfront, iterate based on feedback, treat as living document

### Risk: SAP Structure Doesn't Fit

**Likelihood**: Medium (haven't deeply engaged chora-base on structure)
**Impact**: Medium (can modify proposal, but delays timeline)
**Mitigation**: Multiple options presented (new SAPs vs modify vs hybrid), flexible on implementation

### Risk: Coordination Overhead

**Likelihood**: Low (measured 1.8% overhead in chora-workspace)
**Impact**: Medium (perception that SAPs are bureaucratic)
**Mitigation**: Emphasize lightweight (Git-native, no external tools), show ROI evidence, multiple adoption levels

### Risk: Adoption Friction

**Likelihood**: Medium (new patterns, learning curve)
**Impact**: Low (voluntary adoption, can evolve gradually)
**Mitigation**: Pre-filled templates, step-by-step guides, chora-workspace as working example

## Open Questions

### SAP Structure

1. Should these be new SAPs or modifications to existing SAPs?
2. If new, what numbers? (SAP-014, SAP-015 or different?)
3. How do we handle versioning as patterns evolve?

### Philosophy Integration

4. Should philosophy be a separate SAP or embedded in others?
5. How do we document "kin-based collaboration" for external readers without sounding weird?
6. What's the right balance of humble uncertainty vs clear guidance?

### Template Library

7. How should coordination templates integrate with chora-base templates?
8. Should capability declarations be part of project template (like README.md)?
9. How do we version templates as they evolve through use?

### Adoption Path

10. Should SAP adoption be progressive (Phase 1/2/3 like context loading)?
11. What's minimum viable adoption? (Just capability declaration? Full inbox protocol?)
12. How do we support repos with different contexts/needs?
