  "response_time_hours": 0.5,
  "status": "accepted_with_phased_approach",

  "decision": "ACCEPT with phased Sprint 1 + Sprint 2 implementation. Prioritizing high-impact, low-effort deliverables first.",

  "summary": "COORD-003 is accepted for implementation across two sprints. The pilot adoption feedback is excellent - quantitative metrics, specific friction points, and ready-to-contribute validation tools. We'll implement 7/10 deliverables in Sprint 1-2, deferring checkpoint system and telemetry to backlog pending further design discussion.",

  "rationale": {
    "problem_acknowledged": "The pilot adoption revealed 15 specific friction points across ergonomics (4), efficiency (4), and effectiveness (7). While SAP Sets significantly improved onboarding (71% token reduction, 94% time reduction), gaps remain that compound difficulty for new adopters, particularly AI agents working autonomously.",

    "solution_approach": "Phased implementation focusing on quick wins first. Sprint 1 addresses blockers (pre-flight validation) and reduces decision paralysis (visual decision tree, FAQ). Sprint 2 enhances UX (progress indicators, agent-specific guides). Checkpoint system deferred pending design refinement.",

    "key_advantages": [
      "All dependencies met (Wave 5 complete, SAP Sets shipped)",
      "Well-researched with quantitative pilot data (3-4 hour onboarding, 18/18 SAPs verified)",
      "Offers ready-to-use validation tools (validate-infrastructure.sh, verify-sap-awareness.py)",
      "High ROI: 4-6 hour effort for 90%+ impact (per pilot metrics)",
      "Directly supports v4.x ecosystem growth objectives",
      "Clear acceptance criteria and success metrics"
    ],

    "strategic_alignment": "Reducing onboarding friction from 3-4 hours to <2 hours will significantly accelerate ecosystem adoption. Each improvement reduces barrier to entry for AI agents and human adopters."
