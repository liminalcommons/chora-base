## Friction Point Analysis

### High-Impact Friction Points (Should Address First)

#### 1. Decision Paralysis on SAP Set Selection
**Severity**: High
**Frequency**: Every adopter encounters this
**Time Cost**: 15-30 minutes reading documentation

**Current State**:
- Must read docs/user-docs/reference/standard-sap-sets.md (544 lines)
- Must read docs/user-docs/how-to/install-sap-set.md (535 lines)
- Must understand use cases for 5 different sets

**Proposed Solution**:
```
START HERE: Choose Your SAP Set
‚îú‚îÄ Are you just exploring chora-base? ‚Üí minimal-entry (5 SAPs, 3-5 hours)
‚îú‚îÄ Building a production project? ‚Üí recommended (10 SAPs, 1-2 days)
‚îú‚îÄ Quality/testing focus? ‚Üí testing-focused (6 SAPs, 4-6 hours)
‚îú‚îÄ Building MCP server? ‚Üí mcp-server (10 SAPs, 1 day)
‚îî‚îÄ Want everything? ‚Üí full (18 SAPs, 2-4 weeks)
```

**Expected Impact**: Reduce decision time from 30 min ‚Üí 2 min (93% reduction)

#### 2. Missing Prerequisites Not Caught Early
**Severity**: High
**Frequency**: Estimated 40-60% of adopters
**Time Cost**: 10-60 minutes troubleshooting mid-installation

**Current State**:
- No pre-flight check before installation
- Errors surface during installation
- Must diagnose: Python version? Git installed? Permissions?

**Proposed Solution**:
```bash
# Run before install-sap.py
./scripts/validate-prerequisites.sh

Checking prerequisites...
  ‚úÖ Python 3.11+ installed (3.12.0)
  ‚úÖ Git installed (2.39.0)
  ‚úÖ Write permissions in target directory
  ‚úÖ Disk space available (15 GB free)
  ‚ö†Ô∏è  'just' not installed (optional but recommended)

Ready to proceed? [Y/n]
```

**Expected Impact**: Prevent 90%+ of mid-installation failures

#### 3. No Progress Indication During Installation
**Severity**: Medium
**Frequency**: Every installation
**Time Cost**: Anxiety/uncertainty, may interrupt prematurely

**Current State**:
- Silent installation for several seconds/minutes
- Unclear if process is frozen or working
- No ETA for completion

**Proposed Solution**:
```bash
Installing SAP Set: minimal-entry
[=====>              ] 2/5 SAPs installed (40%)
Estimated time remaining: ~3 minutes

Currently installing: SAP-001 (inbox-coordination)
  ‚Üí Copying 5 artifacts...
  ‚Üí Installing system files (inbox/)...
  ‚úì Validation passed
```

**Expected Impact**: Reduce premature cancellations, improve UX

### Medium-Impact Friction Points

#### 4. Agent-Specific Guides Buried in Generic Documentation
**Severity**: Medium
**Frequency**: 100% of AI agents
**Time Cost**: 30-60 minutes parsing 2000+ line guide

**Current State**:
- AGENT_SETUP_GUIDE.md is 2000+ lines
- Generic content mixed with agent-specific patterns
- Must extract relevant sections

**Proposed Solution**:
Create agent-specific quickstarts:
- `docs/user-docs/how-to/quickstart-claude.md` (200 lines)
- `docs/user-docs/how-to/quickstart-codex.md` (200 lines)
- `docs/user-docs/how-to/quickstart-generic.md` (200 lines)

**Expected Impact**: 70% reduction in time-to-first-action for agents

#### 5. Common Issues Not Documented
**Severity**: Medium
**Frequency**: Estimated 30-50% of adopters
**Time Cost**: 5-30 minutes per issue

**Issues Encountered During Pilot**:
1. ‚ùì "Which SAP set should I choose?" (decision paralysis)
2. ‚ùì "5 SAPs showing as incomplete" (template repo vs generated project confusion)
3. ‚ùì "Where do system files go?" (static-template/ vs repo root)
4. ‚ùì "How do I verify installation succeeded?" (validation commands scattered)
5. ‚ùì "Can I install more SAPs later?" (progressive adoption path unclear)

**Proposed Solution**:
Create `docs/user-docs/troubleshooting/onboarding-faq.md` with top 10-15 questions

**Expected Impact**: Reduce support burden, self-service troubleshooting

#### 6. Success Criteria Unclear at Each Tier
**Severity**: Medium
**Frequency**: Every adopter
**Time Cost**: 10-20 minutes uncertainty

**Current State**:
- No explicit "you're done" checkpoints
- Unclear what "successful onboarding" means
- No validation checklist

**Proposed Solution**:
```markdown
## Essential Tier Success Checklist
- [ ] SAP-000 installed (5 artifacts present)
- [ ] Can run: `python scripts/install-sap.py --list-sets`
- [ ] Can validate links: `./scripts/validate-links.sh .`
- [ ] AGENTS.md present and readable
Time: Should complete in <10 minutes

## Recommended Tier Success Checklist
- [ ] All essential checks pass
- [ ] Tests run: `pytest`
- [ ] Coverage ‚â•85%: `pytest --cov`
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks install: `pre-commit install`
- [ ] Just commands work: `just --list`
Time: Should complete in <30 minutes

## Advanced Tier Success Checklist
- [ ] All recommended checks pass
- [ ] Docker builds: `docker build -t test .`
- [ ] All 18 SAPs present
- [ ] Memory system initialized
Time: Should complete in <1 hour
```

**Expected Impact**: Clear finish line, confidence in completeness

### Low-Impact Friction Points (Nice-to-Have)

#### 7. No Checkpoint/Resume System
**Severity**: Low
**Frequency**: 5-10% of adopters (session interruption)
**Time Cost**: Must restart from scratch (30-180 minutes)

**Current State**:
- If session interrupted, no state saved
- Must remember where you left off
- May duplicate work

**Proposed Solution**:
```json
// .chora-onboarding-progress.json
{
  "started": "2025-10-30T10:00:00Z",
  "phase": "installation",
  "saps_installed": ["SAP-000", "SAP-001"],
  "saps_remaining": ["SAP-009", "SAP-016", "SAP-002"],
  "next_step": "Install SAP-009 (agent-awareness)"
}
```

**Expected Impact**: Enable session resume, reduce frustration

#### 8. No Onboarding Metrics Collection
**Severity**: Low
**Frequency**: N/A (product improvement, not user friction)
**Time Cost**: 0 for users, impacts team's ability to improve

**Current State**:
- No data on actual onboarding times
- No error rate tracking
- No bottleneck identification

**Proposed Solution**:
```bash
# Optional telemetry (privacy-preserving, opt-in)
Log onboarding metrics? [y/N]: y

# Logs to .chora-onboarding-metrics.json (local only)
{
  "total_time": "3h 24m",
  "phase_times": {
    "reading": "45m",
    "installation": "32m",
    "validation": "8m"
  },
  "errors_encountered": 0,
  "sap_set": "minimal-entry"
}
```

**Expected Impact**: Data-driven onboarding improvements

## Questions for chora-base Team

### Clarification Needed

1. **Telemetry**: Is optional, privacy-preserving, opt-in onboarding metrics collection acceptable for the project philosophy?

2. **Integration vs Separate**: Should validation tools be:
   - Integrated into install-sap.py (single tool)
   - Separate scripts (scripts/validate-*.sh)
   - Both (scripts call into install-sap.py)

3. **Contributed Tools**: Are the validation scripts created during pilot adoption useful for inclusion in chora-base?
   - validate-infrastructure.sh
   - verify-sap-awareness.py
   - INFRASTRUCTURE_VERIFICATION.md

4. **Visual Format**: What's the preferred format for visual decision trees?
   - Mermaid diagrams (markdown-native)
   - PNG/SVG images
   - ASCII art for terminal display
   - All of the above

5. **Documentation Location**: Should agent-specific quickstart guides live in:
   - `docs/user-docs/how-to/` (alongside other how-tos)
   - `docs/agent-guides/` (dedicated directory)
   - Root directory (QUICKSTART_CLAUDE.md)

6. **Scope**: Is the checkpoint/resume system in scope for this coordination request, or should it be deferred to future work?

### Feedback Requested

1. **Prioritization**: Does the suggested sprint 1/sprint 2/backlog prioritization align with team roadmap?

2. **Effort Estimates**: Are the estimated hours reasonable based on team's experience with similar work?

3. **Success Metrics**: How should we measure success of onboarding improvements?
   - Adoption time reduction?
   - Error rate decrease?
   - Support ticket volume?
   - Community feedback?
