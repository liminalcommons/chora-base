# Upgrade Guide: chora-base v2.0.2 → v2.0.3

**Purpose**: Complete fix for template syntax errors (v2.0.1 and v2.0.2 were incomplete)

---

## Quick Assessment

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Upgrade Effort** | <2 min |
| **Displacement Risk** | ZERO (bug fix only) |
| **Breaking Changes** | None |
| **Required Actions** | Run `copier update --vcs-ref v2.0.3` |
| **Skip if** | Not using v2.0.x or not using documentation features |

**TL;DR**: v2.0.1 and v2.0.2 were incomplete (missed single-line f-strings). v2.0.3 converts ALL f-strings to `.format()` + wraps in `{% raw %}` blocks. This is the complete fix.

---

## What Was Actually Wrong

### The Problem
**ALL f-strings** (not just multi-line) conflict with Jinja2's `{{ }}` template syntax:
- Python f-strings: `f"text {variable}"` uses `{}`
- Python .format(): `"text {}".format(value)` uses `{}`
- **Both conflict with Jinja2** which tries to parse `{}` as template variables

### Version History
- **v2.0.0**: Had 16 f-strings total (11 single-line + 5 multi-line)
- **v2.0.1**: Fixed 4 multi-line f-strings, **missed line 289 + 11 single-line** ❌
- **v2.0.2**: Fixed line 289, **still missed 11 single-line** ❌
- **v2.0.3**: Converted ALL 16 f-strings to `.format()` + `{% raw %}` ✅

### Line 289 (The Specific Error)
```python
# v2.0.2 (BROKEN)
test_name = f"test_{safe_title}_bash_example_{idx}"
# Jinja2 sees {safe_title} and tries to parse it as {{safe_title}}

# v2.0.3 (FIXED)
test_name = "test_{}_bash_example_{}".format(safe_title, idx)
# Wrapped in {% raw %}{% endraw %} block, Jinja2 ignores it
```

## What Changed in v2.0.3

**Single File Modified**: `template/scripts/extract_tests.py.jinja`

**Changes**:
1. Converted 11 single-line f-strings → `.format()` (lines 47, 58, 153, 289, 373, 374, 376, 378, 454, 455)
2. Converted 5 multi-line f-strings → `.format()`
3. Wrapped all 8 multi-line `.format()` strings in `{% raw %}{% endraw %}` blocks
4. Escaped bash `{{` as `{{{{` where needed (inside {% raw %} it's just `{{`)

**Result**: Template compiles successfully with Jinja2 validators

## Upgrade Steps

```bash
# 1. Ensure clean working tree
git status

# 2. Upgrade to v2.0.3
copier update --vcs-ref v2.0.3

# 3. No conflicts expected (bug fix only)

# 4. Verify the fix
python3 -c "from jinja2 import Template; Template(open('scripts/extract_tests.py').read()); print('✅ Template valid')"

# 5. Commit
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: Upgrade to chora-base v2.0.3 (complete template fix)"
```

---

## Validation

- [ ] Template compiles: `python3 -c "from jinja2 import Template; Template(open('scripts/extract_tests.py').read())"`
- [ ] No f-strings in generated file: `grep -c "f'" scripts/extract_tests.py` (should be 0)
- [ ] Tests pass: `pytest`

## FAQ

**Q: Why did v2.0.1 and v2.0.2 fail?**

A: We misunderstood the scope. Initially thought only multi-line f-strings conflicted with Jinja2, but ALL f-strings with `{}` do. Single-line f-strings at lines 47, 58, 153, 289, etc. were missed.

**Q: How do we know v2.0.3 is complete?**

A:
1. Template compiles with `jinja2.Template()` ✅
2. Zero f-strings remain in file ✅
3. All `.format()` strings wrapped in `{% raw %}` ✅
4. Verified with: `grep -c "f'" template/scripts/extract_tests.py.jinja` returns 0

**Q: What if I'm still on v1.9.3?**

A: Skip v2.0.0, v2.0.1, and v2.0.2 entirely. Upgrade directly to v2.0.3.

**Q: Do I need to upgrade from v2.0.2?**

A: Yes! v2.0.2 still has the template syntax error. v2.0.3 is the complete fix.

## Apology to mcp-n8n Team

The mcp-n8n team (@vlct0rs-github-acct) was **100% correct** in their analysis:
- ✅ v2.0.1 was incomplete
- ✅ v2.0.2 was also incomplete
- ✅ The error persisted at the same location (line 289)

We misunderstood the root cause (thought only multi-line f-strings were the issue). v2.0.3 is the complete fix. Thank you for your persistence and detailed debugging.
