# SAP-018: chora-compose Meta - Capability Charter

**SAP ID**: SAP-018
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Status**: Active
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Category**: Ecosystem Meta-Documentation SAP

---

## What This Is

**chora-compose Meta** is a comprehensive meta-level documentation package that provides deep understanding of chora-compose architecture, design philosophy, integration patterns, and ecosystem positioning. It complements [SAP-017](../chora-compose-integration/) (lightweight integration guide) with architectural depth and strategic context.

This SAP is for developers, architects, and platform engineers who need to understand the *why* and *how* of chora-compose at a systems level, make architectural decisions, contribute to chora-compose, or build ecosystem tooling.

**Key Capabilities**:
- Comprehensive architecture documentation (container orchestration, networking, volumes, scaling)
- Design philosophy and principles (composition over configuration, DX-first, trade-offs)
- Integration pattern catalog (chora-base, MCP servers, multi-project, CI/CD, production)
- Ecosystem positioning (vs. Kubernetes, Tilt, Skaffold, DevContainers)
- Historical context and evolution
- Contribution guidelines and extension patterns

---

## Why This Exists

### The Problem

Understanding Docker Compose-based systems at a deep level requires:
- Scattered documentation (official docs, blog posts, Stack Overflow)
- Implicit design decisions (why this pattern, not that?)
- Missing context (historical evolution, trade-offs)
- No ecosystem perspective (how does this fit with other tools?)
- Limited architectural guidance (scaling, production, multi-project)

**Time Investment**: 10-20 hours researching, testing, understanding patterns
**Knowledge Gaps**: Why certain patterns exist, when to use alternatives, how to extend

### The Solution

SAP-018 provides comprehensive meta-documentation that:
- ✅ Consolidates architectural knowledge in one place
- ✅ Explains *why* design decisions were made (trade-offs documented)
- ✅ Provides historical context (evolution from 2015 to 2025)
- ✅ Catalogs integration patterns (12+ patterns with examples)
- ✅ Positions chora-compose in ecosystem (comparisons with alternatives)
- ✅ Enables informed decision-making (when to use, when not to use)

**Time Investment**: 1-2 hours to read, comprehensive understanding achieved
**Knowledge**: Architecture, philosophy, patterns, ecosystem fit, contribution paths

**ROI**: Saves 8-18 hours of research, reduces architectural mistakes, enables confident customization
