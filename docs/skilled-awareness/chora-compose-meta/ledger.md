## 5. Architecture Evolution

### Evolution 1: Component Model
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Date**: 2025-10-29
**Change**: Initial 3-layer architecture (Access, Core, Infrastructure)
**Rationale**: Clear separation of concerns, modular design
**Impact**: Establishes foundation for future extensions

### Evolution 2: MCP Tool Catalog
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Date**: 2025-10-29
**Change**: Documented 17 tools across 6 categories
**Rationale**: Complete API surface documentation
**Impact**: Enables tool discovery and usage planning

_Document architectural changes as chora-compose evolves._

## 6. Known Gaps

| # | Gap | Impact | Plan | Status | Identified |
|---|-----|--------|------|--------|------------|
| 1 | API modality not yet implemented | No REST API access | Roadmap item - track in chora-compose releases | Planned | 2025-10-29 |
| 2 | Tool catalog needs validation against actual implementation | Documentation accuracy | Verify each tool exists and matches spec | In Progress | 2025-10-29 |
| 3 | No performance benchmarks documented | Can't predict generation times | Add performance section in future revision | Planned | 2025-10-29 |

_Track documentation gaps and remediation plans._

## 7. Version Compatibility

| SAP-018 Version | chora-compose Version | Coverage | Status | Notes |
|----------------|----------------------|----------|--------|-------|
| 1.0.0 | v1.2.0 | 17 tools, 5 resources | ✅ Current | Initial documentation |

_Update as chora-compose releases new versions._

## 9. Change History

- **2025-10-29:** Initial ledger created as part of SAP-018 documentation set (version 1.0.0)
- **2025-10-29:** SAP-018 published with complete protocol spec, architecture overview, design philosophy, integration patterns
- **2025-10-29:** Completed coord-001 coordination request (chora-compose SAP creation)
- **2025-10-29:** Documented 17 MCP tools + 5 resource URI families + 4 access modalities

---

## 10. Meta-Documentation Notes

**SAP-018 Purpose**: Unlike SAP-017 (integration guide), SAP-018 serves as the **authoritative architectural reference** for chora-compose. It answers "What is chora-compose?" rather than "How do I use it?"

**Audience**:
- Architects evaluating chora-compose for adoption
- Developers contributing to chora-compose
- Platform engineers integrating chora-compose
- Anyone needing complete system understanding

**Maintenance Strategy**:
- Track chora-compose releases via GitHub watch
- Update on MINOR version changes (new tools/features)
- Mark deprecated features clearly
- Maintain roadmap section for future capabilities
