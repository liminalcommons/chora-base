## Adoption Record

### Primary Adoption: chora-base

**Project**: chora-base v3.4.0 (Wave 2)
**Adoption Date**: 2025-10-28
**Adopter**: chora-base core team
**Context**: Wave 2 SAP audit requires link validation for all 15 SAPs

**Adoption Details**:
- **Phase**: Wave 2, Phase 1 (Foundation)
- **Motivation**:
  - Wave 1 restructured 279 files across 4 domains - manual link checking infeasible
  - 15 SAPs reference content across dev-docs/, project-docs/, user-docs/, system files
  - Need automated way to ensure cross-domain references remain valid
  - Quality gate for Wave 2 release: 100% link validity

- **Implementation Scope**:
  - Created all 5 SAP-016 artifacts (charter, protocol, awareness-guide, blueprint, ledger)
  - Implemented `scripts/validate-links.sh` (bash script)
  - Validated all Wave 1 documentation (279 files)
  - Integrated into SAP Audit Workflow (Step 3)
  - CI/CD integration (GitHub Actions) - *planned*
  - Pre-commit hooks - *optional, documented*

**Outcomes** (to be updated post-Wave 2):
- Files validated: 279 markdown files
- Broken links found: *TBD* (validation not yet run)
- Broken links fixed: *TBD*
- Time saved: *TBD* (estimated 8+ hours vs. manual checking)
- SAPs audited with link validation: *TBD* (target: 15/15)

**Challenges Encountered**: *TBD* (script implementation pending)

**Adaptations Made**: *TBD*

**Feedback**:
- *To be collected during Wave 2 execution*

## Version History

### v1.0 (2025-10-28) - Initial Creation

**Changes**:
- Created all 5 SAP-016 artifacts
- Defined link validation protocol (internal + external links)
- Documented adoption blueprint (installation + CI/CD integration)
- Created ledger for tracking adoption

**Scope**:
- Internal markdown links (relative paths, absolute repo paths)
- External HTTP/HTTPS links (basic reachability)
- Anchor links (file-level only, content parsing deferred to v2.0)

**Deliverables**:
- `capability-charter.md` - Business value, scope, guarantees
- `protocol-spec.md` - Inputs, outputs, processing rules
- `awareness-guide.md` - Usage examples, integration patterns
- `adoption-blueprint.md` - Installation, CI/CD setup, troubleshooting
- `ledger.md` - Adoption tracking (this file)
- `scripts/validate-links.sh` - Implementation (pending)

**Known Limitations**:
- No anchor content validation (requires markdown parsing) - Deferred to v2.0
- No image asset validation - Separate SAP candidate
- External link validation is best-effort (network-dependent)
- Bash script not compatible with Windows native (requires WSL)

**Next Steps**:
- Implement validation script
- Test on Wave 1 documentation (279 files)
- Use in SAP audit workflow (15 SAPs)
- Integrate into CI/CD pipeline

## Enhancement Roadmap

### Planned Enhancements (v2.0)

**Anchor Content Validation** (High Priority):
- **Problem**: Currently validates file exists, but not that anchor (section) exists
- **Solution**: Parse markdown, extract headings, validate anchor links
- **Benefit**: Catch broken section references (e.g., `#security-considerations` when section renamed)
- **Effort**: Medium (requires markdown parsing library or regex)

**Parallel File Processing** (Medium Priority):
- **Problem**: Large repositories (500+ files) take 2+ minutes
- **Solution**: Process files in parallel (10-20 concurrent)
- **Benefit**: 3-5x speedup for large repositories
- **Effort**: Medium (bash parallelization with `xargs` or `parallel`)

**Link History Tracking** (Low Priority):
- **Problem**: Can't see when links broke or how long they've been broken
- **Solution**: Store validation results, track link health over time
- **Benefit**: Identify chronic link rot, measure improvement
- **Effort**: High (requires database or persistent storage)

---

### Considered but Deferred

**Image Asset Validation**:
- **Why deferred**: Different link syntax, separate concern
- **Future**: Candidate for SAP-017 (Image Asset Management)

**Code Comment Link Validation**:
- **Why deferred**: Too noisy, often hypothetical examples
- **Future**: Optional flag if demand emerges

**HTML Link Validation**:
- **Why deferred**: Different parsing requirements, markdown focus
- **Future**: Could extend script if demand emerges

**Deep External Link Validation** (Content Checking):
- **Why deferred**: Slow (5-10 minutes for full repo), diminishing returns
- **Future**: Optional flag for thorough pre-release validation

## Metrics & Impact

### Quantitative Metrics

**For chora-base** (to be measured post-Wave 2):
- Total files validated: 279 markdown files
- Total links validated: *TBD* (estimated ~1,500-2,000)
- Broken links found: *TBD*
- False positive rate: *TBD* (target <5%)
- Validation runtime: *TBD* (target <2 minutes full repo)
- Time saved: *TBD* (estimated 8+ hours vs. manual)

**For external adopters** (to be measured post-distribution):
- Projects adopted: *TBD*
- Combined files validated: *TBD*
- Combined broken links caught: *TBD*
- Average adoption time: *TBD* (target <2 hours)

---

### Qualitative Impact

**Expected Benefits** (to be validated):
- ✅ Increased confidence in documentation accuracy
- ✅ Faster documentation refactors (no fear of broken links)
- ✅ Improved user experience (no broken references)
- ✅ Reduced support burden (fewer "link doesn't work" issues)
- ✅ Higher quality releases (link validation as quality gate)

**Risk Mitigation**:
- ❌ Prevents broken links from reaching users
- ❌ Catches refactor-induced link breakage early
- ❌ Detects external link rot before users encounter it
