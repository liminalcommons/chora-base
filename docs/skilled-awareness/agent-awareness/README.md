# SAP-009: Agent Awareness System

**Version:** 1.1.0 | **Status:** Active | **Maturity:** Production

> Nested AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md pattern with 5-level hierarchy—progressive context loading saves 60-70% tokens through "nearest file wins" navigation.

---

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

```bash
# Read root awareness (project overview)
cat CLAUDE.md

# Navigate to domain-specific awareness
cat docs/skilled-awareness/CLAUDE.md

# Read SAP-specific awareness
cat docs/skilled-awareness/inbox/CLAUDE.md

# Validate awareness structure
bash scripts/validate-awareness-links.sh
```

**First time?** → Read root [CLAUDE.md](../../../CLAUDE.md) for navigation guide

---

## What Is It?

SAP-009 provides the **nested AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md pattern** with 5-level hierarchy (root → domain → SAP → feature → component) for progressive context loading. The "nearest file wins" principle enables agents to navigate efficiently, loading only necessary context and achieving 60-70% token savings vs reading all documentation upfront.

**Key Innovation**: Meta-SAP documenting the awareness system itself—proves SAP framework can capture recursive, self-referential systems.

---

## When to Use

Use SAP-009 when you need to:

1. **Progressive context loading** - Load docs incrementally (0-10k → 10-50k → 50-200k tokens)
2. **Nested navigation** - Navigate from root → domain → capability → feature
3. **Token optimization** - 60-70% savings through domain-specific awareness files
4. **Self-documenting systems** - Capture meta-patterns and recursive structures
5. **Agent onboarding** - Guide agents through project structure efficiently

**Not needed for**: Simple projects (<5 files), or if project has single README only

## Key Features

- ✅ **5-Level Hierarchy** - root → domain → SAP → feature → component
- ✅ **"Nearest File Wins"** - Read closest AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md for context
- ✅ **60-70% Token Savings** - Domain-specific files vs reading all docs
- ✅ **Progressive Loading** - 3 phases (Essential 0-10k, Extended 10-50k, Comprehensive 50-200k)
- ✅ **Dual Files** - AGENTS.md (generic) + CLAUDE.md (Claude-specific)
- ✅ **Validation** - Scripts check structure, links, token tracking
- ✅ **Integration** - ALL 32+ SAPs use this pattern

## Common Workflows

### 5-Level Hierarchy

```
/CLAUDE.md                          ← Level 1: Root (project overview)
/AGENTS.md

docs/skilled-awareness/             ← Level 2: Domain (SAP capabilities)
├── CLAUDE.md
├── AGENTS.md
│
├── inbox/                          ← Level 3: SAP (specific capability)
│   ├── CLAUDE.md
│   ├── AGENTS.md
│   │
│   └── features/                   ← Level 4: Feature (optional)
│       ├── CLAUDE.md
│       └── coordination.md
│
└── scripts/                        ← Level 5: Component (optional)
    ├── CLAUDE.md
    └── specific-script-patterns.md
```

### 3 Progressive Loading Phases

#### Phase 1: Essential (0-10k tokens)
**Goal**: Understand project structure and navigation

**Read**:
- `/CLAUDE.md` - Root navigation guide
- Domain-level `CLAUDE.md` for target area

**Output**: Know where to find detailed information

---

#### Phase 2: Extended (10-50k tokens)
**Goal**: Load technical specifications for task

**Read**:
- SAP-level `protocol-spec.md` for complete technical details
- SAP-level `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` for operating patterns

**Output**: Complete technical understanding

---

#### Phase 3: Comprehensive (50-200k tokens)
**Goal**: Deep understanding for complex implementations

**Read**:
- `capability-charter.md` for design rationale
- `ledger.md` for adoption metrics
- `adoption-blueprint.md` for installation from scratch
- Source code files as needed

**Output**: Comprehensive understanding

## Integration

| SAP | Integration | How It Works |
|-----|-------------|--------------|
| **SAP-000** (SAP Framework) | Foundation | All SAPs use nested awareness pattern |
| **SAP-002** (Chora-Base) | Meta-Container | Chora-base itself uses SAP-009 for navigation |
| **ALL 32+ SAPs** | Universal Pattern | Every SAP has AGENTS.md + awareness-guide.md (or CLAUDE.md) |
| **SAP-016** (Link Validation) | Quality | Validates awareness file links |
| **SAP-031** (Enforcement) | Layer 3 | Awareness structure validation (5-10% prevention) |

---

## Success Metrics

- **Token Savings**: 60-70% via domain-specific awareness files
- **Coverage**: 100% of SAPs have AGENTS.md/awareness-guide.md
- **Navigation Efficiency**: 3-level lookup finds any capability in <30s
- **Integration**: ALL 32+ SAPs use this pattern (universal adoption)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem 1: Awareness File Not Found

**Symptom**: Agent navigates to expected location but AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md doesn't exist

**Cause**: Awareness file not created for that domain/SAP/feature level

**Fix**:
1. Check if domain has awareness file: `ls docs/skilled-awareness/AGENTS.md`
2. If missing, create using adoption-blueprint.md guidance
3. Validate structure: `bash scripts/validate-awareness-links.sh`

**Validation**: File exists and contains required 7 sections

---

### Problem 2: Token Limit Exceeded During Progressive Loading

**Symptom**: Agent loads too much context and hits 200k token limit

**Cause**: Loading Phase 3 (Comprehensive) when Phase 1 (Essential) would suffice

**Fix**:
1. Use progressive loading phases:
   - Phase 1 (0-10k tokens): Root + domain AGENTS.md only
   - Phase 2 (10-50k tokens): Add SAP-specific awareness
   - Phase 3 (50-200k tokens): Only for complex implementations
2. Apply "nearest file wins" - read domain-specific file instead of root

**Validation**: Token usage stays within budget for task complexity

---

### Problem 3: Circular Navigation Loop

**Symptom**: Agent navigates root → domain → root → domain repeatedly

**Cause**: Unclear navigation hints or missing domain-specific awareness

**Fix**:
1. Add clear "Next Steps" section to root AGENTS.md pointing to domains
2. Create domain-specific CLAUDE.md with explicit navigation tree
3. Use file path breadcrumbs: "You are in: /docs/skilled-awareness/"

**Validation**: Agent reaches target file in ≤3 navigation steps
