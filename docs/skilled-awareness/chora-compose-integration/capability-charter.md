# SAP-017: chora-compose Integration - Capability Charter

**SAP ID**: SAP-017
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Status**: Active
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Category**: Ecosystem Integration SAP

---

## What This Is

**chora-compose Integration** is a capability package that enables developers to integrate [chora-compose](https://github.com/liminalcommons/chora-compose) - a Docker Compose-based orchestration system for AI agent development environments - with their chora-base Python projects.

This SAP provides integration patterns, configuration guidance, and best practices for leveraging chora-compose's containerized development workflows alongside chora-base project structures.

**Key Capabilities**:
- Docker Compose integration patterns for chora-base projects
- Multi-container orchestration for AI agent environments
- Volume management for persistent data and code
- Environment configuration and secrets management
- Service dependency coordination (databases, APIs, MCP servers)
- Development workflow patterns (local, Docker, hybrid)

---

## Why This Exists

### The Problem

Integrating Docker-based development environments with Python projects requires:
- Understanding Docker Compose service orchestration
- Managing volume mounts for local development
- Configuring environment variables and secrets
- Coordinating service dependencies (databases, APIs, tools)
- Balancing local development speed vs. containerized consistency
- Debugging containerized services

**Time Investment**: 4-8 hours for first integration, 1-2 hours per subsequent project
**Error Rate**: High (volume mount issues, environment config, network problems)

### The Solution

SAP-017 provides production-ready integration patterns that:
- ✅ Implement best practices for Docker Compose + chora-base
- ✅ Include working volume mount configurations
- ✅ Provide environment variable patterns and examples
- ✅ Document service dependency patterns
- ✅ Offer debugging strategies for common issues
- ✅ Support hybrid workflows (local + Docker)

**Time Investment**: 30-60 minutes for first integration, 10-15 minutes per subsequent project
**Error Rate**: Low (battle-tested patterns, documented troubleshooting)

**ROI**: Saves 3-7 hours per project integration, reduces containerization debugging time

---

## Who Should Use This

### Primary Audience

**Python Developers with chora-base Projects**:
- Building AI agents or MCP servers with chora-base
- Need containerized development environments
- Want reproducible builds across machines
- Deploying to Docker-based production environments

**Team Leads / Platform Engineers**:
- Standardizing development environments across teams
- Managing multi-developer projects
- Ensuring environment consistency
- Building CI/CD pipelines with Docker

### Secondary Audience

**AI Application Developers**:
- Developing applications with multiple service dependencies
- Prototyping integrations with databases, APIs, tools
- Testing multi-container architectures

**DevOps Engineers**:
- Deploying chora-base projects to production
- Managing containerized AI agent infrastructure
- Building platform-as-a-service offerings

### Anti-Audience (Who Should NOT Use This)

**Don't use SAP-017 if**:
- Not using chora-base Python projects (no integration needed)
- Don't need Docker/containers (local development sufficient)
- Using non-Docker orchestration (Kubernetes, serverless, VMs)
- Building simple scripts (containerization overkill)

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Multi-Container Orchestration

**Capability**: Coordinate multiple services (Python app, database, API gateways, MCP servers) using Docker Compose.

**Use Cases**:
- AI agent + PostgreSQL database + Redis cache
- MCP server + n8n workflow automation + monitoring
- Multi-server development (frontend + backend + AI services)

**Patterns**:
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml example
services:
  app:
    build: .
    volumes:
      - .:/workspace
    depends_on:
      - db
      - redis

  db:
    image: postgres:15-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: myapp
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE: /run/secrets/db_password
    volumes:
      - postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    volumes:
      - redis-data:/data

volumes:
  postgres-data:
  redis-data:
```

**Benefits**:
- Single command startup: `docker compose up`
- Automatic service discovery
- Dependency ordering
- Health check coordination

---

### 2. Volume Management

**Capability**: Mount local code, data, and configuration into containers for live development.

**Use Cases**:
- Live code reloading (edit locally, run in container)
- Persistent database data across container restarts
- Shared configuration files
- Log file access from host

**Patterns**:
```yaml
services:
  app:
    volumes:
      # Source code (read-write for development)
      - .:/workspace:delegated
      # Python dependencies (cache)
      - pip-cache:/root/.cache/pip
      # Configuration (read-only)
      - ./config:/app/config:ro
      # Logs (writable, accessible from host)
      - ./logs:/app/logs
```

**Benefits**:
- Fast development iteration (no rebuild for code changes)
- Persistent data (databases, caches)
- Local file access (logs, outputs)
- Dependency caching (faster rebuilds)

---

### 3. Environment Configuration

**Capability**: Manage environment variables, secrets, and configuration across services.

**Use Cases**:
- API keys and credentials
- Database connection strings
- Feature flags
- Service endpoints

**Patterns**:
```yaml
services:
  app:
    env_file:
      - .env.local      # Local overrides (gitignored)
      - .env.defaults   # Default values (committed)
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@db:5432/myapp
      - REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379
      - LOG_LEVEL=${LOG_LEVEL:-INFO}
    secrets:
      - api_key
      - db_password

secrets:
  api_key:
    file: ./secrets/api_key.txt
  db_password:
    file: ./secrets/db_password.txt
```

**Benefits**:
- Secure secrets management (not in code)
- Environment-specific configuration
- Default values with overrides
- Docker secrets integration

---

### 4. Service Dependencies

**Capability**: Define startup order and health checks for interdependent services.

**Use Cases**:
- Database must start before application
- API gateway depends on backend services
- MCP server needs database connection

**Patterns**:
```yaml
services:
  app:
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
      redis:
        condition: service_started
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "python", "-c", "import sys; sys.exit(0)"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 3

  db:
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "pg_isready", "-U", "postgres"]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 3s
      retries: 5
```

**Benefits**:
- Reliable startup order
- Automatic retry on failures
- Service readiness verification
- Graceful degradation

---

### 5. Network Isolation

**Capability**: Isolate service communication within Docker networks.

**Use Cases**:
- Internal services (database, cache) not exposed to host
- Multiple projects on same machine (no port conflicts)
- Security boundaries (frontend/backend isolation)

**Patterns**:
```yaml
services:
  app:
    networks:
      - frontend
      - backend
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"  # Exposed to host

  db:
    networks:
      - backend      # Only backend network (not exposed)

networks:
  frontend:
    driver: bridge
  backend:
    driver: bridge
    internal: true  # No external access
```

**Benefits**:
- Service isolation
- Port conflict prevention
- Security boundaries
- Multi-project support

---

### 6. Development Workflow Support

**Capability**: Support hybrid workflows (local Python + Docker services) and full containerization.

**Use Cases**:
- Run Python locally, databases in Docker
- Full containerization for production parity
- Mix local tools (IDE, debugger) with Docker services

**Patterns**:
```yaml
# Hybrid: Local Python + Docker services
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:15-alpine
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"  # Exposed for local Python
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: dev
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: dev

  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"  # Exposed for local Python

# Full: Everything in Docker
services:
  app:
    build: .
    volumes:
      - .:/workspace
    depends_on:
      - db
      - redis
  # ... (db, redis without port exposure)
```

**Benefits**:
- Flexibility (choose local vs. Docker per service)
- Fast iteration (local Python debugging)
- Production parity (full containerization)
- IDE support (local Python with Docker services)
