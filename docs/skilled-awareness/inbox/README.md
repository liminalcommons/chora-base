# Cross-Repository Inbox Skilled Awareness Package

This directory contains the working artefacts for the inbox SAP:

- `capability-charter.md` — Context, scope, outcomes, and lifecycle for the capability.
- `protocol-spec.md` — Normative behavior, interfaces, and governance.
- `awareness-guide.md` — Operator playbook for Claude/Codex and human maintainers.
- `adoption-blueprint.md` — Installation and validation steps for downstream repositories.
- `ledger.md` — Adoption status, feedback log, and action tracking.

Refer to `../document-templates.md` for the generic template definitions and `../workflow-mapping.md` for lifecycle guidance. When these documents change materially, update the ledger and broadcast through the inbox coordination channel.
