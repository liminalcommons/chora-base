# Inbox SAP Pilot Plan – chora-compose

**Objective:** Execute the adoption blueprint in the `chora-compose` repository to validate install steps, surface friction, and refine the SAP artefacts.

---

## Stakeholders
- **Pilot Maintainer:** Victor Piper
- **Agent Support:** Codex assistant (primary), Claude Code (secondary)
- **Reviewers:** chora-compose maintainers (if distinct), ecosystem coordination group

---

## Preparation Checklist
- [x] Confirm `chora-compose` repo access and current coordination workflows. _(2025-10-27)_
- [ ] Copy SAP documents (`docs/reference/skilled-awareness/inbox/`) into pilot repo or link to canonical versions.
- [ ] Ensure root `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` ready for awareness references.
- [ ] Create tracking issue or inbox coordination request announcing pilot.

## Execution Steps
1. Follow manual installation path in adoption blueprint (Option A).
2. Customize capability descriptor (`coordination/CAPABILITIES/chora-compose.yaml`) with repo-specific info.
3. Update awareness guide references in root documentation.
4. Perform smoke checks: sample coordination + task flow, event emission.
5. Capture agent experience using dry-run checklist (if time permits).
