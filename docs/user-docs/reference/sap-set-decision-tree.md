---

## Can I Change Later?

**YES! SAP sets are additive and non-exclusive.**

### Adding Individual SAPs

Install additional SAPs anytime:
```bash
python3 scripts/install-sap.py SAP-004  # Add testing framework
python3 scripts/install-sap.py SAP-007  # Add documentation framework
```

### Upgrading to a Different Set

Install another SAP set (won't reinstall existing SAPs):
```bash
# Started with minimal-entry, now want recommended
python3 scripts/install-sap.py --set recommended

# The installer skips SAPs you already have
```

### Checking What's Installed

```bash
ls docs/skilled-awareness/ | grep SAP-
```

---

## Installation Commands

### Pre-Flight Check (Run First!)

```bash
bash scripts/validate-prerequisites.sh
```

### Dry-Run (See What Will Happen)

```bash
python3 scripts/install-sap.py --set minimal-entry --dry-run
```

### Install Your Chosen Set

```bash
# minimal-entry (recommended for first-timers)
python3 scripts/install-sap.py --set minimal-entry

# testing-focused
python3 scripts/install-sap.py --set testing-focused

# mcp-server
python3 scripts/install-sap.py --set mcp-server

# recommended
python3 scripts/install-sap.py --set recommended

**When in doubt, start with `minimal-entry`.**

**Why**:
- Smallest time investment (3-5 hours)
- Covers essentials for ecosystem participation
- You can always add more SAPs later
- Low risk, high learning value

   ls -d docs/skilled-awareness/SAP-* | wc -l
   # Should match your chosen set's SAP count
   ```

2. **Each SAP has 5 artifacts**:
   ```bash
   ls docs/skilled-awareness/SAP-000-sap-framework/
   # Should see: BLUEPRINT.md, INDEX.md, AGENTS.md, README.md, SPECIFICATION.md
   ```

3. **Can read a SAP**:
   ```bash
   cat docs/skilled-awareness/SAP-000-sap-framework/README.md
   # Should display without errors
   ```

### Troubleshooting

If installation failed or validation fails, see:
- [Onboarding FAQ](../troubleshooting/onboarding-faq.md) - Common issues and solutions
