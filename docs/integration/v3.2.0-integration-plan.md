## Executive Summary

### Current State Analysis

**Already Complete (from previous session):**
- âœ… **7,440 lines of workflow documentation** exist in static-template/
  - 5,115 lines: workflows/ (DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS, DDD, BDD, TDD, LIFECYCLE)
  - 1,309 lines: ANTI_PATTERNS.md
  - 1,016 lines: examples/FEATURE_WALKTHROUGH.md
- âœ… **All core files created** in static-template/
- âœ… **CHANGELOG [Unreleased] section** already documents all additions
- âœ… **Most infrastructure complete**

**What Needs Completion:**
1. Create 4 missing README files (consistency with chora-base patterns)
2. Enhance 2 blueprints (README, ROADMAP) with workflow cross-references
3. Update 3 root docs (BENEFITS, README, AGENT_SETUP_GUIDE)
4. Release v3.2.0 (move [Unreleased] â†’ [3.2.0])
5. Validate all cross-references and links
6. QA test with generated project

**Estimated Time:** 4.5 hours (vs. original proposal's 6.5 hours)

**Why Faster:**
- Most workflow docs already exist (no need to create them)
- CHANGELOG [Unreleased] already written
- project-docs/README.md already exists from v3.1.1 curation
- Only 4 new files needed (vs. 7 originally planned)
