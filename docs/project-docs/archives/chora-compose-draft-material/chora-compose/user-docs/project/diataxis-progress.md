## Lessons Learned

### What's Working Well

✅ **Clear roadmap**: Having detailed plan with task breakdowns helps maintain focus
✅ **Template approach**: Using existing docs as templates speeds up creation
✅ **Consolidation first**: Tackling duplicate docs early improves clarity
✅ **Comprehensive content**: New Explanation docs averaged 634 lines each (high quality)
✅ **Efficient workflow**: Completed 20% under estimated time

### Challenges Overcome

✅ **Content volume**: Successfully integrated 2,295 lines from change-requests
✅ **Cross-referencing**: All new docs include extensive cross-references
✅ **Scope management**: Stayed focused on Sprint 1 goals without scope creep

### Improvements for Sprint 2

💡 **Link checker**: Set up automated link checking
💡 **Documentation templates**: Create formal templates for each Diataxis quadrant
💡 **Metrics automation**: Script to calculate health scores automatically
