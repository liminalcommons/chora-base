## Key Insights and Discoveries

### Discovery 1: A-MEM as Core Philosophy ⭐

**Observation**: SAP-010 marked `included_by_default: false` but generated by fast-setup

**Analysis**: A-MEM (Agent Memory) is a **foundational chora-base principle**, not just an optional add-on. The 4-subsystem architecture (events, knowledge, profiles, traces) provides:
- **Event Sourcing**: Immutable audit log
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Relationship modeling
- **Agent Profiles**: Personalization and context
- **Distributed Tracing**: Request flow tracking

**Impact**: Projects adopting chora-base get **enterprise-grade observability** out-of-the-box.

**Recommendation**: Update SAP-010 catalog to `included_by_default: true` to reflect reality.

---

### Discovery 2: L2 Enhancement Velocity 🚀

**Observation**: SAP-013 L2 verification took only 45 minutes vs typical 1.5-2h for L1

**Analysis**: L2 enhancements **build on verified L1 foundations**, making them faster to verify. L1 does the heavy lifting (setup, file structure, core functionality), L2 adds incremental capabilities.

**Pattern**:
- **L1**: 1.5-2 hours (infrastructure setup)
- **L2**: 45-60 minutes (capability enhancement)
- **L3**: 30-45 minutes (optimization)

**Impact**: Multi-level SAPs offer **progressive value delivery** with decreasing time investment per level.

**Recommendation**: Prioritize L2/L3 enhancements for already-verified SAPs to maximize ROI.

---

### Discovery 3: Event-Driven Integration Pattern 🎯

**Observation**: SAP-010 and SAP-013 achieved **8/8 integration points PASS** with zero custom glue code

**Analysis**: Event-driven architecture creates **natural integration boundaries**:
- Events are self-describing (schema + metadata)
- Multiple consumers can read same event stream
- Temporal decoupling (write once, read anytime)
- Extensible (new metrics = new event queries)

**Example**:
```python
# No custom integration needed
with open('.chora/memory/events/development.jsonl') as f:
    for line in f:
        event = json.loads(line)
        # Metrics extraction happens naturally
        if event['event_type'] == 'claude_session_end':
            calculator.add_metric_from_event(event)
```

**Impact**: Reduces integration complexity, increases SAP composability.

**Recommendation**: Encourage event-driven patterns in future SAP designs.

---

### Discovery 4: Catalog Metadata Divergence ⚠️

**Issue**: Growing evidence of catalog metadata not matching reality

**Examples**:
- SAP-010: `included_by_default: false` but is included
- SAP-009: `included_by_default: false` but is included
- SAP-013: Catalog doesn't specify L2/L3 levels

**Impact**: Makes planning harder, requires verification to discover truth.

**Recommendation**:
1. Run catalog audit after Week 10
2. Update catalog to reflect actual fast-setup behavior
3. Add `adoption_levels` field to catalog (L1/L2/L3 availability)

---

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Tier 2 Completion Timeline ⚠️

**Status**: Tier 2 at 60% (3/5), need 80% (4/5) by Week 7

**Remaining Tier 2 SAPs**:
- SAP-011: docker-operations (if Tier 2)
- SAP-0XX: Unknown 5th Tier 2 SAP

**Mitigation**:
- Week 7: Verify SAP-011 + 1 more Tier 2 SAP
- Fallback: Verify 1 Tier 2 + start Tier 3 if only 4 SAPs in Tier 2

**Likelihood**: LOW (Week 7 target achievable)

---

### Risk 2: Multi-Level SAP Complexity 📊

**Status**: SAP-013 now has L1 + L2 verified

**Challenge**: Tracking which SAPs are at which levels

**Current State**:
- SAP-013: L1 ✅ (Week 2), L2 ✅ (Week 6)
- Other SAPs: L1 only

**Mitigation**:
- Add "Adoption Level" column to PROGRESS_SUMMARY.md
- Document L2/L3 paths in individual SAP reports
- Create SAP_LEVELS.md tracking matrix

**Likelihood**: MEDIUM (manageable with better tracking)

---

### Risk 3: Fast-Setup Catalog Accuracy 🔍

**Status**: Multiple SAPs marked `included_by_default: false` are actually included

**Impact**: Planning estimates may be off (expect incremental, get pre-verified)

**Mitigation**:
- Pre-flight checks MUST verify actual generated project
- Don't rely solely on catalog flags
- Document discrepancies in verification reports

**Likelihood**: LOW (pre-flight checks catch this)

---

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well ✅

1. **L2 Enhancement Strategy**: Faster than new SAP verification, high ROI
2. **Event-Driven Integration**: Natural fit between memory and metrics
3. **Pre-Flight Verification**: Checking actual project vs catalog saved time
4. **Template-Driven Reporting**: Consistent structure across weeks
5. **Clear L1/L2 Criteria**: Adoption blueprints make verification straightforward

### What Could Improve ⚠️

1. **Catalog Accuracy**: Need audit to align metadata with reality
2. **Tier Definitions**: Not all Tier 2 SAPs clearly identified
3. **Multi-Level Tracking**: Need better system for L1/L2/L3 progress
4. **Integration Testing**: Should be part of every verification (formalize)
5. **Time Estimates**: Improving but still conservative (47% under this week)

### What to Try Next Week 🚀

1. **Complete Tier 2**: Target 80% (4/5) or 100% (5/5)
2. **Start Tier 3**: If Tier 2 complete, begin specialization SAPs
3. **L2 Batch**: If multiple SAPs have L2 paths, batch verify for efficiency
4. **Catalog Audit**: Document all discrepancies found to date
5. **Integration Matrix**: Formalize which SAPs integrate with which

## Week 7 Planning Recommendations

### Primary Target: Complete Tier 2 🎯

**Option A: SAP-011 + SAP-014** (2 new SAPs)
- **Goal**: Reach 80% Tier 2 (4/5)
- **Time**: 3-4 hours estimated
- **Pros**: Major tier progress, 2 new capabilities
- **Cons**: Longer time investment

**Option B: SAP-011 + SAP-013 L3** (1 new + 1 enhancement)
- **Goal**: Reach 60% Tier 2 (3/5) + L3 capability
- **Time**: 2.5-3 hours estimated
- **Pros**: Faster, SAP-013 L1→L2→L3 complete
- **Cons**: Only 1 new SAP

**Option C: Complete Tier 2 + Start Tier 3** (2 new Tier 2 + 1 Tier 3)
- **Goal**: 100% Tier 2 (5/5) + 11% Tier 3 (1/9)
- **Time**: 4-5 hours estimated
- **Pros**: Major milestone (Tier 2 complete), momentum into Tier 3
- **Cons**: Longer session, 3 SAPs in one week

**RECOMMENDATION**: **Option A** (SAP-011 + SAP-014)

**Rationale**:
1. Completes Tier 2 to 80% (close to 100%)
2. 2 new capabilities vs 1 new + 1 enhancement
3. Time estimate aligns with campaign pace
4. Sets up Week 8 to finish Tier 2 + start Tier 3

---

### Pre-Flight Checks for Week 7

**Before starting Week 7**:

1. ✅ Confirm SAP-011 (docker-operations) is Tier 2
2. ✅ Confirm SAP-014 exists and is Tier 2
3. ✅ Check if SAP-011/014 pre-included in fast-setup
4. ✅ Verify adoption blueprints have clear L1 criteria
5. ✅ Review Week 6 integration patterns for reuse

**Contingency**: If SAP-014 doesn't exist or isn't Tier 2, pivot to SAP-013 L3 enhancement.
