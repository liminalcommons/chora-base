# Week 5 Verification Plan: SAP-008 & SAP-012

**Date Created**: 2025-11-09
**Target Week**: Week 5
**SAPs**: SAP-008 (automation-scripts), SAP-012 (development-lifecycle)
**Verification Method**: Fast-setup verification (check pre-generated files)
**Estimated Duration**: 4-5 hours

---

## Executive Summary

Week 5 completes Tier 1 (Core Infrastructure) by verifying SAP-008 and SAP-012. Both SAPs are categorized as incremental (`"included_by_default": false`), but based on Week 4's learning about SAP-009, we should verify if files are pre-generated by fast-setup.

**Key Strategy**: Pre-flight check to determine if scripts/ and justfile already exist in Week 3 generated project.

---

## SAP Categorization

### SAP-008: Automation Scripts
- **Category**: Incremental SAP (expected)
- **Included by Default**: `false` (confirmed)
- **Current Version**: 1.5.0
- **Verification Method**: TBD (check if pre-generated)

### SAP-012: Development Lifecycle
- **Category**: Incremental SAP (expected)
- **Included by Default**: `false` (confirmed)
- **Current Version**: 1.5.0
- **Verification Method**: TBD (check if pre-generated)

---

## Pre-Flight Checks (CRITICAL)

Before planning detailed verification, check if files already exist:

### SAP-008 Files Check
```bash
cd docs/project-docs/verification/verification-runs/2025-11-09-week3-sap-005-006/generated-project

# Check for justfile
test -f justfile && echo "✓ justfile exists" || echo "✗ justfile missing"

# Check for scripts directory
test -d scripts && echo "✓ scripts/ directory exists" || echo "✗ scripts/ missing"

# Count scripts (expected: ~25)
find scripts/ -name "*.sh" -o -name "*.py" | wc -l
```

### SAP-012 Files Check
```bash
# Check for workflow documentation
test -d dev-docs/workflows && echo "✓ dev-docs/workflows exists" || echo "✗ dev-docs/workflows missing"

# Count workflow docs (expected: ~6 files)
find dev-docs/workflows -name "*.md" | wc -l

# Check for specific workflows
test -f dev-docs/workflows/DDD_WORKFLOW.md && echo "✓ DDD_WORKFLOW.md exists"
test -f dev-docs/workflows/BDD_WORKFLOW.md && echo "✓ BDD_WORKFLOW.md exists"
test -f dev-docs/workflows/TDD_WORKFLOW.md && echo "✓ TDD_WORKFLOW.md exists"
```

**Decision Point**:
- If files exist → Fast-setup verification (like SAP-009)
- If files missing → Incremental adoption (like SAP-007)

---

## Week 5 Goals

---

## SAP-008: Automation Scripts

### Inferred L1 Criteria

Based on adoption-blueprint.md "Level 1: Basic Usage (Day 1)", the L1 criteria likely are:

| Criterion | Target | Verification Method |
|-----------|--------|---------------------|
| justfile exists | ✅ Required | File exists check |
| ≥5 core commands functional | `test`, `smoke`, `lint`, `pre-merge`, `help` | Command execution |
| scripts/ directory exists | ✅ Required | Directory check |
| ≥10 scripts present | ≥10 scripts | File count |
| `just --list` works | Shows available commands | Command output |

### Step-by-Step Verification

**Step 1: Pre-Flight Check** (5 min)
```bash
cd docs/project-docs/verification/verification-runs/2025-11-09-week3-sap-005-006/generated-project

# Check justfile
test -f justfile && wc -l justfile

# Check scripts directory
ls -la scripts/ | wc -l

# List just commands
just --list 2>/dev/null | head -20
```

**Step 2: Verify Core Commands** (20 min)

If files exist (fast-setup verification):
```bash
# 1. just --list
just --list > /tmp/just-commands.txt
wc -l /tmp/just-commands.txt

# 2. just help
just help 2>/dev/null

# 3. Count scripts
find scripts/ -name "*.sh" -o -name "*.py" | wc -l

# 4. Verify script categories (from protocol-spec)
# Category 1: Setup (4 scripts)
# Category 2: Development (4 scripts)
# Category 3: Version Management (2 scripts)
# Category 4: Release (4 scripts)
# Category 5: Safety (2 scripts)
# Category 6: Documentation (5 scripts)
# Category 7: MCP (2 scripts)
# Category 8: Migration (2 scripts)
# Total expected: 25 scripts
```

**Step 3: Test Sample Commands** (15 min)
```bash
# Test read-only commands (safe to run)
just --list          # Should list commands
just help            # Should show help

# Note: Don't run write commands (test, smoke, build) as they may fail
# in generated project without full setup
```

**Step 4: Document Results** (30 min)
- Create SAP-008-VERIFICATION.md
- Record L1 criteria results
- Note any blockers
- Make GO/CONDITIONAL GO/NO-GO decision

### Expected Decision

**Best Case**: GO ✅
- justfile exists with ≥20 commands
- scripts/ directory exists with ≥20 scripts
- `just --list` and `just help` work
- Core script categories present

**Acceptable**: CONDITIONAL GO ⚠️
- Files exist but some scripts missing
- justfile works but limited commands
- Need minor fixes

**Worst Case**: NO-GO ❌
- justfile missing
- scripts/ directory missing or empty
- Need full incremental adoption

---

## SAP-012: Development Lifecycle

### Inferred L1 Criteria

Based on adoption-blueprint.md "Level 1: Development Focus (DDD→BDD→TDD)", the L1 criteria likely are:

| Criterion | Target | Verification Method |
|-----------|--------|---------------------|
| dev-docs/workflows/ exists | ✅ Required | Directory check |
| ≥3 workflow docs present | DDD, BDD, TDD | File count |
| DDD_WORKFLOW.md exists | ✅ Required | File check |
| BDD_WORKFLOW.md exists | ✅ Required | File check |
| TDD_WORKFLOW.md exists | ✅ Required | File check |
| Workflow docs ≥200 lines each | Substantial content | Line count |

### Step-by-Step Verification

**Step 1: Pre-Flight Check** (5 min)
```bash
cd docs/project-docs/verification/verification-runs/2025-11-09-week3-sap-005-006/generated-project

# Check workflows directory
test -d dev-docs/workflows && echo "✓ dev-docs/workflows exists"

# List workflow docs
ls -la dev-docs/workflows/*.md

# Count workflow docs
find dev-docs/workflows -name "*.md" | wc -l
```

**Step 2: Verify Core Workflows** (20 min)

If files exist (fast-setup verification):
```bash
# Check for 3 core workflows
test -f dev-docs/workflows/DDD_WORKFLOW.md && \
  wc -l dev-docs/workflows/DDD_WORKFLOW.md

test -f dev-docs/workflows/BDD_WORKFLOW.md && \
  wc -l dev-docs/workflows/BDD_WORKFLOW.md

test -f dev-docs/workflows/TDD_WORKFLOW.md && \
  wc -l dev-docs/workflows/TDD_WORKFLOW.md

# Check content quality (first 20 lines)
head -20 dev-docs/workflows/DDD_WORKFLOW.md
head -20 dev-docs/workflows/BDD_WORKFLOW.md
head -20 dev-docs/workflows/TDD_WORKFLOW.md
```

**Step 3: Check Additional Workflows** (10 min)
```bash
# Look for additional workflow docs
ls dev-docs/workflows/

# Expected additional files (if comprehensive):
# - DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md
# - DEVELOPMENT_LIFECYCLE.md
# - FEATURE_WALKTHROUGH.md
```

**Step 4: Document Results** (30 min)
- Create SAP-012-VERIFICATION.md
- Record L1 criteria results
- Note any blockers
- Make GO/CONDITIONAL GO/NO-GO decision

### Expected Decision

**Best Case**: GO ✅
- dev-docs/workflows/ exists with ≥6 workflow docs
- All 3 core workflows present (DDD, BDD, TDD)
- Each workflow ≥200 lines (substantial)
- Additional supporting docs present

**Acceptable**: CONDITIONAL GO ⚠️
- 3 core workflows present but sparse content
- Missing supporting docs
- Need content enhancement

**Worst Case**: NO-GO ❌
- dev-docs/workflows/ missing
- Core workflow docs missing
- Need full incremental adoption

---

## Cross-Validation Opportunities

### SAP-008 → SAP-012 Integration

**Test**: Do scripts support lifecycle workflows?

**Checks**:
1. Does `just test` exist? (supports TDD)
2. Does `just pre-merge` exist? (supports quality gates)
3. Are there scripts for version bumping? (supports release workflow)
4. Does AGENTS.md reference both scripts and workflows?

**Expected**: SAP-008 scripts should implement SAP-012 workflows

### SAP-012 → SAP-008 Integration

**Test**: Do workflow docs reference automation scripts?

**Checks**:
1. Does DDD_WORKFLOW.md mention `just` commands?
2. Does BDD_WORKFLOW.md reference test scripts?
3. Does TDD_WORKFLOW.md reference `just test`?

**Expected**: Workflow docs should guide users to use scripts

## Risk Assessment

### Known Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Scripts not pre-generated | Medium | High | Fall back to incremental adoption |
| Workflow docs not pre-generated | Medium | High | Fall back to incremental adoption |
| Scripts require full environment | Low | Medium | Test only read-only commands |
| Complex L1 criteria definition | Medium | Low | Infer from adoption blueprints |

### Contingency Plans

**If SAP-008 NO-GO (scripts missing)**:
- Adopt incrementally: Copy scripts/ and justfile from static-template/
- Estimated time: 2-3 hours
- Still achievable within Week 5

**If SAP-012 NO-GO (workflows missing)**:
- Adopt incrementally: Copy dev-docs/workflows/ from static-template/
- Estimated time: 1-2 hours
- Still achievable within Week 5

**If Both NO-GO**:
- Total incremental adoption time: 3-5 hours
- Week 5 may extend to 8-10 hours total
- Still on track for Week 11 completion

## Notes

**Important Insights from Week 4**:
- Some "incremental" SAPs are pre-generated despite `"included_by_default": false`
- Always do pre-flight checks before planning verification method
- Fast-setup verification is much faster than incremental adoption

**Tier 1 Significance**:
- Tier 1 represents core infrastructure SAPs
- Completing Tier 1 means the foundation is solid
- Milestone worth celebrating as it enables all higher tiers

**Week 5 Unique Challenge**:
- SAP-008 and SAP-012 are more complex than previous SAPs
- May have more files and components to verify
- L1 criteria are inferred from adoption blueprints (not explicitly stated)
