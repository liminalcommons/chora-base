# Release Notes: v3.4.0 - Wave 1 Complete

**Version**: v3.4.0
**Release Date**: 2025-10-28
**Wave**: Wave 1 - Documentation Architecture Unification
**Status**: Complete

---

## Executive Summary

v3.4.0 completes Wave 1 of the chora-base v4.0 transformation, establishing the universal 4-domain documentation architecture across the entire repository. This release restructures 279 files while maintaining 100% coherence and demonstrates the meta-dogfooding approach by using chora-base's own framework during its development.

**Key Achievement**: chora-base now has a consistent, LLM-navigable documentation structure ready for external adoption and upstream merges.

---

## What's New

### 4-Domain Documentation Architecture

chora-base documentation now follows a universal structure:

```
docs/
├── dev-docs/          ← For developers working ON the product
├── project-docs/      ← Project lifecycle artifacts
├── user-docs/         ← For users of the delivered product
└── skilled-awareness/ ← SAP Framework (meta-layer)
```

**Benefits**:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Consistent with static-template/
- LLM-navigable (predictable file locations)
- Upgradeable structure (merge from upstream)

See: [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md)
