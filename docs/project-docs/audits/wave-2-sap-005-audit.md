## Step 1: Read & Analyze

### Capability Summary
**Primary Capability**: CI/CD Workflows - GitHub Actions workflows for generated projects

**Business Value**:
- Automates quality checks (testing, linting, type checking, security)
- Enforces quality gates before merge (coverage 85%, no linting errors)
- Reduces manual testing overhead by 60-80%
- Provides consistent CI/CD pipeline across all generated projects

**Key Components**:
- test.yml - Pytest with coverage (85% threshold)
- lint.yml - Ruff linting + mypy type checking
- security.yml - Bandit security scanning
- build.yml - Docker image builds

### Artifact Completeness

| Artifact | Lines | Status | Notes |
|----------|-------|--------|-------|
| capability-charter.md | 192 | ✅ Complete | Clear business case, ROI metrics |
| protocol-spec.md | 452 | ✅ Complete | Detailed workflow specifications |
| awareness-guide.md | 335 | ✅ Complete | Enhanced with Phase 5 additions |
| adoption-blueprint.md | 108 | ✅ Complete | Workflow adoption guide |
| ledger.md | 57 | ✅ Complete | Adoption tracking |

## Step 2: Cross-Domain Gap Analysis

**Coverage Score**: 4/4 domains (100%)

**Domain Coverage**:
- ✅ dev-docs/ - TDD/BDD workflows, pytest, ruff, mypy tools
- ✅ project-docs/ - CI/CD setup guide, workflow monitoring
- ✅ user-docs/ - GitHub Actions tutorials, workflow debugging
- ✅ skilled-awareness/ - Related SAPs (003, 004, 006, 008, 013)

---

## Step 3: Link Validation

**Results**:
- Before: ~10 broken links ❌
- After: 0 broken links ✅
- Status: PASS ✅

**Links Fixed**:
- Updated all paths for 4-domain structure
- Fixed workflow file references (.github/workflows/*.yml)
- Verified all cross-SAP references

---

## Step 4-6: Content Completeness & Enhancements

**Overall Completeness**: 5/5 artifacts pass (100%)

**Enhancements Applied** (Phase 5):

### 1. "When to Use" Section
Added clear decision criteria at the top of awareness guide:
- When to use this SAP (5 scenarios)
- When NOT to use (4 anti-patterns)
- Focus on workflow debugging and CI/CD troubleshooting

### 2. "Common Pitfalls" Section (5 Scenarios)
Added practical pitfall scenarios with examples:

1. **Not Understanding security.yml Runs Only on main Branch**
   - Problem: Agent expects security scan on feature branches
   - Fix: Understand branch triggers in workflow on: sections
   - Impact: Prevents confusion about "missing" security scans

2. **Running Full Workflows Locally Instead of Individual Tools**
   - Problem: Agent tries to simulate entire workflow locally
   - Fix: Run pytest/ruff/mypy directly, not workflow YAML
   - Impact: Faster feedback (seconds vs minutes)

3. **Not Understanding Workflow Triggers (push vs pull_request)**
   - Problem: Agent doesn't understand when workflows run
   - Fix: Study on: triggers in each workflow file
   - Impact: Prevents unexpected workflow behavior

4. **Cache Misses Causing Slow CI Runs**
   - Problem: Workflows reinstall dependencies every run
   - Fix: Check actions/cache configuration, verify cache keys
   - Impact: Reduces CI time by 40-60%

5. **Assuming Workflows Guarantee Code Quality**
   - Problem: Agent relies solely on CI, skips local testing
   - Fix: Run tests locally before push, use pre-commit hooks
   - Impact: Prevents broken commits, faster iteration

### 3. "Related Content" Section (4-Domain Coverage)
Enhanced with comprehensive cross-references:
- Within SAP: All 5 artifacts cross-linked
- dev-docs/: Testing workflows, CI/CD tools, quality standards
- project-docs/: GitHub Actions setup, workflow monitoring
- user-docs/: Workflow tutorials, debugging guides
- skilled-awareness/: Related SAPs (003, 004, 006, 008, 013)

**Content Added**: ~200 lines (awareness-guide.md: 335 lines total)

**Version Update**: 1.0.0 → 1.0.1
