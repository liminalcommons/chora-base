- Accumulates knowledge incrementally (Zettelkasten-style graph)
- Provides trace correlation for multi-step workflows (debug across sessions)
- Preserves agent preferences (portable profiles)
- Reduces repeated mistakes by 60-80% (research-backed learning effectiveness)

**Key Components**:
- Event Log (append-only, 6-month retention)
- Knowledge Graph (atomic notes with bidirectional links)
- Agent Profiles (capabilities, preferences, learned patterns)
- Trace Correlation (multi-step workflows linked by trace_id)
- Query interfaces for cross-session context
