## Step 1: Read & Analyze

### Capability Summary
**Primary Capability**: SAP Framework - Standardized capability packaging system

**Business Value**:
- Reduces adoption friction (4-8h → 1-2h per capability)
- Zero upgrade failures through clear migration paths
- Reduces support burden by 80%

**Key Components**:
- 5 core artifacts: charter, protocol, awareness-guide, blueprint, ledger
- Blueprint-based installation (agent-executable)
- Semantic versioning with sequential upgrades
- Cross-repository coordination

### Artifact Completeness

| Artifact | Lines | Status | Notes |
|----------|-------|--------|-------|
| capability-charter.md | 383 | ✅ Complete | Comprehensive problem statement, lifecycle phases |
| protocol-spec.md | 689 | ✅ Complete | Detailed technical contract, artifact schemas |
| awareness-guide.md | 546 | ⚠️ Needs update | Has path issues, needs concrete examples |
| adoption-blueprint.md | 551 | ⚠️ Needs update | Has path issues |
| ledger.md | 281 | ✅ Adequate | Tracks chora-base adoption |
| **Total** | **2,450** | **⚠️ Needs Work** | Path updates required |

---

## Step 2: Cross-Domain Gap Analysis

### dev-docs/ References

| Reference | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| `../../../../static-template/dev-docs/workflows/DEVELOPMENT_LIFECYCLE.md` | ❌ Broken path | File exists at correct path, but reference is broken |
| `../../writing-executable-howtos.md` | ❌ Broken path | File is `docs/user-docs/how-to/write-executable-documentation.md` |

**Assessment**: 0/2 references valid (0%)

**Issues**:
- Needs to reference actual dev-docs/ workflows (SAP creation workflow)
- Path structure assumes old docs/reference/ location

### project-docs/ References

| Reference | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| `../chora-base-sap-roadmap.md` | ✅ Valid | Correctly references roadmap |

**Assessment**: 1/1 references valid (100%)

### user-docs/ References

**Assessment**: 0 references found (0%)

**Gap**: No user-facing documentation for SAP framework

**Recommended additions**:
- `user-docs/explanation/what-are-saps.md` - Conceptual overview
- `user-docs/how-to/create-a-sap.md` - User-facing creation guide
- `user-docs/reference/sap-artifact-structure.md` - Quick reference

### skilled-awareness/ References

| Reference | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| `../INDEX.md` | ✅ Valid | SAP registry |
| `../document-templates.md` | ✅ Valid | Templates |
| `../inbox/` | ✅ Valid | Reference implementation |
| `../../../../SKILLED_AWARENESS_PACKAGE_PROTOCOL.md` | ❌ Broken path | File exists at root, but path resolution fails |

**Assessment**: 3/4 references valid (75%)

### System File References

| Reference | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| `scripts/` | ✅ Valid | Directory exists |
| Root files | ⚠️ Mixed | Most exist, but path references broken |

---

## Step 3: Link Validation

**Run Command**:
```bash
./scripts/validate-links.sh docs/skilled-awareness/sap-framework/
```

**Results**:
```
Files scanned: 5
Links checked: 83
Broken links: 17 ❌
Status: FAIL ❌
```

### Categorized Broken Links

#### Critical (Must Fix) - 10 links

**Path migration issues** (old `docs/reference/skilled-awareness/` → new `docs/skilled-awareness/`):

1. `awareness-guide.md:16` → `docs/reference/skilled-awareness/<capability-name>/`
2. `awareness-guide.md:36` → `docs/reference/skilled-awareness/*/capability-charter.md`
3. `awareness-guide.md:41` → `docs/reference/skilled-awareness/<sap>/capability-charter.md`
4. Multiple references to old path structure throughout all artifacts

**Root protocol path issues**:

5-9. Multiple artifacts reference `../../../../SKILLED_AWARENESS_PACKAGE_PROTOCOL.md`
   - **Issue**: Path resolution fails (resolves to `../SKILLED_AWARENESS_PACKAGE_PROTOCOL.md`)
   - **File exists**: Yes, at repo root
   - **Solution**: Use `/SKILLED_AWARENESS_PACKAGE_PROTOCOL.md` (absolute from repo root)

**Workflow references**:

10. `capability-charter.md:367` → `../../../../static-template/dev-docs/workflows/DEVELOPMENT_LIFECYCLE.md`
    - **Issue**: Path resolution fails
    - **File exists**: Yes
    - **Solution**: Use correct relative path or absolute path

#### Should Fix - 7 links

**Placeholder paths** (intentionally generic in examples):
- `<sap>/adoption-blueprint.md`
- `<sap>/ledger.md`
- `<capability-name>/`
- These are examples/placeholders, should be marked as such or use actual SAP references

- [ ] Examples are concrete (many are placeholders like `<sap>/`)
- [x] Cross-domain references present (2 domains: skilled-awareness, project-docs)
- [ ] Common pitfalls documented (missing)
- [x] Related content linked
- **Assessment**: ⚠️ **PARTIAL** - Needs concrete examples, common pitfalls

### Adoption Blueprint
- [x] Prerequisites explicit
- [x] Installation steps actionable
- [x] Validation criteria clear
- [ ] Tool dependencies listed (assumes git, AI agent)
- [x] Project-specific adaptation guidance
- **Assessment**: ⚠️ **PARTIAL** - Needs explicit tool dependencies
