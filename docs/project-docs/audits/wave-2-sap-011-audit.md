- Added concrete "When to Use" section with clear triggers and anti-patterns
- Integrated 4-domain cross-references (dev-docs/, project-docs/, user-docs/, skilled-awareness/)
- Strong foundation with comprehensive protocol spec and nested awareness patterns
- Completed efficiently (~1.5h actual vs 2h estimated)

## Step 1: Read & Analyze

### Capability Summary
**Primary Capability**: Agent Awareness - Hierarchical AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md awareness files with "Nearest File Wins" pattern

**Business Value**:
- Reduces context loading time by 40-60% (progressive loading strategy)
- Standardizes awareness file structure across projects
- Provides domain-specific guidance (tests/, scripts/, docker/)
- Enables efficient token budget management for different task types

**Key Components**:
- Dual-file pattern (AGENTS.md generic + CLAUDE.md Claude-specific)
- Nested awareness hierarchy (root, domain-specific, subdomain)
- "Nearest File Wins" principle for context resolution
- Progressive loading phases (Essential 0-10k, Extended 10-50k, Full 50-200k tokens)
- Token budgets by task type (bug fix 5-10k, small feature 15-30k, large feature 30-60k)

### Artifact Completeness

| Artifact | Lines | Status | Notes |
|----------|-------|--------|-------|
| capability-charter.md | 87 | ✅ Complete | Clear business case, fixed SAP ID (was SAP-009) |
| protocol-spec.md | 284 | ✅ Complete | Detailed nested patterns, context optimization |
| awareness-guide.md | 388 | ✅ Complete | Agent workflows, 5 pitfalls, 4-domain links |
| adoption-blueprint.md | 175 | ✅ Complete | Step-by-step awareness file creation |
| ledger.md | 73 | ✅ Complete | Adoption tracking |
| **Total** | **1,007** | **✅ Complete** | Comprehensive agent awareness documentation |

---

## Step 2: Cross-Domain Gap Analysis

**Coverage Score**: 4/4 domains (100%)

### Domain Coverage

- ✅ **dev-docs/**: workflows/, tools/, development/ (agent-assisted-development, context-management, claude-code, awareness-file-standards)
- ✅ **project-docs/**: blueprints/, guides/, audits/, releases/ (AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md blueprints, creating-awareness-files, token-optimization)
- ✅ **user-docs/**: guides/, tutorials/, reference/ (working-with-agents, creating-custom-agents-file, optimizing-claude-sessions)
- ✅ **skilled-awareness/**: sap-framework/, chora-base/, dependent/supporting SAPs (SAP-000, SAP-002, SAP-003, SAP-007, SAP-008, SAP-009)

---

## Step 3: Link Validation

**Results**:
- Before: ~8 broken links ❌
- After: 0 broken links ✅
- Status: PASS ✅

**Major Fixes**:
- Updated capability-charter.md SAP ID (SAP-009 → SAP-011)
- Fixed 4-domain cross-references in awareness-guide.md

---

## Step 4-6: Content Completeness & Enhancements

**Overall Completeness**: 5/5 artifacts pass (100%)

**Enhancements Applied** (Phase 5 Batch C):
- Fixed critical SAP ID mismatch in capability-charter.md
- Enhanced awareness guide with "When to Use" section
- Added 5 comprehensive "Common Pitfalls" scenarios with Wave 2 learnings
- Enhanced "Related Content" with 4-domain coverage
- Version bumped to 1.0.1

**Key Improvements**:
1. **"When to Use" Section**: Clear triggers (starting on new codebase, optimizing context, understanding domain patterns) and anti-patterns (generic Claude usage, non-hierarchical projects)
2. **5 Common Pitfalls**: Reading root vs domain files, skipping domain files, not using progressive loading, forgetting CLAUDE.md, creating awareness files without protocol
3. **4-Domain Links**: Comprehensive cross-references to dev-docs/, project-docs/, user-docs/, skilled-awareness/

## Metrics

**Time Spent**: ~1.5h (under budget)
**Link Validation**: 100% success rate
**Cross-Domain Coverage**: 4/4 domains (100%)
**Enhancement**: 90 → 388 lines awareness guide (+331%)

---

## Critical Fix: SAP ID Mismatch

**Issue**: capability-charter.md had SAP ID "SAP-009" (should be "SAP-011")
**Impact**: HIGH - Incorrect SAP ID causes confusion in cross-references, tracking, and adoption
**Resolution**: Updated capability-charter.md SAP ID to SAP-011 ✅

**Audit Version**: 1.0 (Final)
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Completion Date**: 2025-10-28
