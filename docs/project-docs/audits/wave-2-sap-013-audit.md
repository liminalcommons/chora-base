## Step 1: Read & Analyze

### Capability Summary
**Primary Capability**: Metrics Tracking - ClaudeROICalculator and process metrics for tracking Claude effectiveness, sprint velocity, and quality trends

**Business Value**:
- Enables ROI calculation for AI-assisted development (~$109,200/year per developer)
- Provides data-driven insights for process improvements
- Tracks quality/velocity trends over time
- Supports stakeholder communication with evidence-based metrics
- Reduces metrics collection time from 2+ hours to 15 min/week

**Key Components**:
- ClaudeMetric dataclass + ClaudeROICalculator utility
- Process metrics (velocity, defect rate, test coverage, DDD/BDD/TDD adherence)
- Sprint/release dashboard templates
- Export formats (JSON, CSV) for backup and analysis
- Metric targets (defect rate <3, coverage ≥90%, velocity ≥80%, adherence ≥80-90%)

### Artifact Completeness

| Artifact | Lines | Status | Notes |
|----------|-------|--------|-------|
| capability-charter.md | 84 | ✅ Complete | Clear business case, ROI metrics |
| protocol-spec.md | 166 | ✅ Complete | Detailed ClaudeROI calculator, process metrics |
| awareness-guide.md | 395 | ✅ Complete | Agent workflows, 5 pitfalls, 4-domain links |
| adoption-blueprint.md | 124 | ✅ Complete | Step-by-step metrics implementation |
| ledger.md | 114 | ✅ Complete | Adoption tracking, version history |
| **Total** | **883** | **✅ Complete** | Comprehensive metrics tracking documentation |

## Step 2: Cross-Domain Gap Analysis

**Coverage Score**: 4/4 domains (100%)

### Domain Coverage

- ✅ **dev-docs/**: workflows/, tools/, development/ (sprint-retrospective, release-retrospective, claude-roi-calculator, metrics-dashboard, metrics-standards)
- ✅ **project-docs/**: sprints/, releases/, guides/, audits/ (sprint metrics, release metrics, metrics-collection, roi-analysis)
- ✅ **user-docs/**: guides/, tutorials/, reference/ (understanding-metrics, tracking-claude-sessions, calculating-roi, metrics-reference, process-targets)
- ✅ **skilled-awareness/**: sap-framework/, chora-base/, dependent/supporting SAPs (SAP-000, SAP-002, SAP-004, SAP-005, SAP-006, SAP-008, SAP-009, SAP-012)

## Step 3: Link Validation

**Results**:
- Before: ~10 broken links ❌
- After: 0 broken links ✅
- Status: PASS ✅

**Major Fixes**:
- Updated 4-domain cross-references in awareness-guide.md
- Fixed static-template/ implementation component paths
- Updated SAP dependency links

---

## Step 4-6: Content Completeness & Enhancements

**Overall Completeness**: 5/5 artifacts pass (100%)

**Enhancements Applied** (Phase 5 Batch C):
- Enhanced awareness guide with "When to Use" section
- Added 5 comprehensive "Common Pitfalls" scenarios with Wave 2 learnings
- Enhanced "Related Content" with 4-domain coverage
- Version bumped to 1.0.1

**Key Improvements**:
1. **"When to Use" Section**: Clear triggers (tracking Claude effectiveness, measuring sprint velocity, calculating ROI, monitoring test coverage, preparing release metrics) and anti-patterns (real-time dashboards, financial accounting, individual performance tracking, granular task timing)
2. **5 Common Pitfalls**: Not tracking time saved accurately, ignoring bugs introduced, comparing metrics across task types, not updating sprint metrics, forgetting to export metrics before changes
3. **4-Domain Links**: Comprehensive cross-references to dev-docs/, project-docs/, user-docs/, skilled-awareness/
