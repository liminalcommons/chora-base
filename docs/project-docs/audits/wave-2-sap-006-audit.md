## Step 1: Read & Analyze

### Capability Summary
**Primary Capability**: Quality Gates - Pre-commit hooks for automated quality checks

**Business Value**:
- Enforces code quality before commits (ruff, mypy, coverage)
- Reduces code review overhead by 40-60%
- Catches issues early (before push) saving CI time
- Standardizes quality standards across team (coverage 85%, strict type checking)

**Key Components**:
- .pre-commit-config.yaml - Hook configuration
- ruff (linting + formatting)
- mypy (type checking)
- pytest (test coverage validation)

### Artifact Completeness

| Artifact | Lines | Status | Notes |
|----------|-------|--------|-------|
| capability-charter.md | 157 | ✅ Complete | Clear problem statement, ROI metrics |
| protocol-spec.md | 364 | ✅ Complete | Detailed hook specifications |
| awareness-guide.md | 369 | ✅ Complete | Enhanced with Phase 5 additions |
| adoption-blueprint.md | 132 | ✅ Complete | Hook adoption guide |
| ledger.md | 61 | ✅ Complete | Adoption tracking |
| **Total** | **1,083** | **✅ Complete** | Comprehensive quality gate documentation |

## Step 2: Cross-Domain Gap Analysis

**Coverage Score**: 4/4 domains (100%)

**Domain Coverage**:
- ✅ dev-docs/ - Code style, ruff, mypy tools
- ✅ project-docs/ - Pre-commit setup, quality standards
- ✅ user-docs/ - Quality gate tutorials, troubleshooting
- ✅ skilled-awareness/ - Related SAPs (003, 004, 005, 007, 008)

---

## Step 3: Link Validation

**Results**:
- Before: ~10 broken links ❌
- After: 0 broken links ✅
- Status: PASS ✅

**Links Fixed**:
- Updated all paths for 4-domain structure
- Fixed tool configuration references
- Verified all cross-SAP references

## Step 4-6: Content Completeness & Enhancements

**Overall Completeness**: 5/5 artifacts pass (100%)

**Enhancements Applied** (Phase 5):

### 1. "When to Use" Section
Added clear decision criteria at the top of awareness guide:
- When to use this SAP (5 scenarios)
- When NOT to use (4 anti-patterns)
- Focus on pre-commit hook configuration and troubleshooting

### 2. "Common Pitfalls" Section (5 Scenarios)
Added practical pitfall scenarios with examples:

1. **Using --no-verify to Bypass Hooks**
   - Problem: Agent uses git commit --no-verify to skip failing hooks
   - Fix: Fix the underlying issue, don't bypass quality gates
   - Impact: Maintains code quality, prevents broken code in repo

2. **Disabling Rules Instead of Fixing Code**
   - Problem: Agent adds # noqa or disables mypy checks to silence errors
   - Fix: Fix the actual code issue, use exceptions sparingly
   - Impact: Preserves code quality, prevents technical debt

3. **Overusing # type: ignore**
   - Problem: Agent adds # type: ignore everywhere to bypass mypy
   - Fix: Add proper type annotations, use ignore only for third-party issues
   - Impact: Maintains type safety benefits, better IDE support

4. **Not Understanding pre-commit run --all-files for Large Commits**
   - Problem: Agent commits many files, hooks time out
   - Fix: Run pre-commit run --all-files before committing
   - Impact: Faster commits, catches issues early

5. **Not Understanding Coverage Gate Applies to Changed Files**
   - Problem: Agent thinks 85% applies to entire codebase
   - Fix: Understand coverage is per-commit, not global
   - Impact: Reduces frustration with coverage requirements

### 3. "Related Content" Section (4-Domain Coverage)
Enhanced with comprehensive cross-references:
- Within SAP: All 5 artifacts cross-linked
- dev-docs/: Code style guide, ruff/mypy tools, quality standards
- project-docs/: Pre-commit setup, quality gate configuration
- user-docs/: Quality gate tutorials, troubleshooting guides
- skilled-awareness/: Related SAPs (003, 004, 005, 007, 008)

**Content Added**: ~220 lines (awareness-guide.md: 369 lines total)

**Version Update**: 1.0.0 → 1.0.1
