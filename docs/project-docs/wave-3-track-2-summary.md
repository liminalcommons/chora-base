## Key Decisions

### 1. External Linking Pattern

**Decision**: Link to external repositories (github.com/liminalcommons/chora-compose) rather than attempting to document chora-compose internals in chora-base.

**Rationale**:
- Avoid documentation duplication
- Single source of truth (chora-compose repo)
- Clear separation: chora-base documents integration, chora-compose documents itself
- Easier maintenance (external repo updates independently)

**Pattern Established**:
```markdown
[chora-compose Repository](https://github.com/liminalcommons/chora-compose)
```

**Reusable**: Yes, for all future ecosystem tool integrations

---

### 2. Two-SAP Structure (Integration + Meta)

**Decision**: Create two SAPs instead of one monolithic SAP.

**Rationale**:
- **SAP-017 (Integration)**: Lightweight, action-oriented, for developers doing integration
- **SAP-018 (Meta)**: Comprehensive, strategy-oriented, for architects and decision-makers
- Separation of concerns: "how to integrate" vs. "why and when to use"
- Allows users to consume only what they need

**Benefits**:
- Faster time-to-value for developers (SAP-017 sufficient)
- Deeper understanding available for architects (SAP-018)
- Reusable pattern for future ecosystem tools

---

### 3. Pattern Catalog Approach

**Decision**: Document 12+ integration patterns rather than prescribing single "correct" way.

**Rationale**:
- Different projects have different needs
- Acknowledge trade-offs (no one-size-fits-all)
- Enable informed decision-making
- Catalog real-world patterns (not theoretical)

**Patterns Documented**:
- Minimal, full stack, hybrid development
- MCP server patterns (single, multi)
- Multi-project patterns (isolated, shared)
- CI/CD patterns (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
- Development workflows (feature branch, hot reload)
- Production considerations

---

### 4. Design Philosophy Documentation

**Decision**: Dedicate ~1,000 lines to design philosophy, principles, and trade-offs.

**Rationale**:
- Help users understand "why" behind patterns
- Enable confident customization (understand principles)
- Reduce architectural regret (trade-offs explicit)
- Historical context informs future decisions

**Impact**:
- Architects can make informed decisions
- Contributors understand system values
- Reduces "why did we do it this way?" questions
- Enables ecosystem consistency

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. **External Linking Pattern**: Clean separation between chora-base and external tools worked well. Will reuse for future ecosystem integrations.

2. **Two-SAP Structure**: SAP-017/018 split received no pushback, seems like correct granularity. Tactical vs. strategic documentation serves different audiences effectively.

3. **Pattern Catalog**: Documenting 12+ patterns (rather than prescribing one) acknowledged real-world diversity. Gives users choice with guidance.

4. **Link Validation**: 0 broken links across 10 documents due to disciplined validation during development. Forward references temporarily marked, then fixed in Phase 3.

5. **Comprehensive Planning**: Sprint plan created upfront with detailed tasks made execution smooth. Knew exactly what to build.

### Challenges Overcome

1. **Volume of Content**: 6,745 lines is substantial. Managed by clear phase separation and focused writing sessions.

2. **Forward References**: SAP-017 referenced SAP-018 before it existed. Solved by temporarily marking as "coming in Phase 2", then fixing in Phase 3.

3. **Pattern Catalog Depth**: Balancing breadth (12 patterns) with depth (detailed examples). Solved by consistent structure: Use Case → Implementation → Benefits → Trade-offs → When to Use.

### Future Improvements

1. **Diagrams**: ASCII art worked, but could benefit from Mermaid diagrams for architecture (future enhancement).

2. **Examples Repository**: Could create companion repo with working examples for each pattern (future SAP extension).

3. **Video Walkthroughs**: Some patterns (especially multi-project orchestration) might benefit from video demonstrations (future enhancement).
