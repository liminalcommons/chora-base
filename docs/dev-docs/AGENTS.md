# Developer Documentation - Agent Awareness

**Domain**: Developer Documentation (dev-docs)
**Audience**: Developers working ON chora-base, contributors, AI agents
**Last Updated**: 2025-11-04

---

## Quick Reference

### What's in dev-docs?

This domain contains **development process documentation** for working on chora-base itself:

- **workflows/**: Complete development lifecycle processes
- **research/**: Technical investigations and learnings
- **patterns/**: Code patterns and best practices
- **examples/**: Code walkthroughs (future)
- **vision/**: Long-term capability roadmap (future)
- **explanation/**: Conceptual deep-dives (future)

### When to Use This Domain

**Use dev-docs when**:
- Contributing to chora-base codebase
- Understanding chora-base architecture
- Following development processes (TDD, BDD, DDD)
- Researching technical decisions

**Don't use dev-docs for**:
- Using chora-base as a template → See [../user-docs/](../user-docs/)
- Adopting SAPs → See [../skilled-awareness/](../skilled-awareness/)
- Project management → See [../project-docs/](../project-docs/)

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Contributing to Chora-Base

**Steps**:
1. Read [workflows/DOCUMENTATION_MIGRATION_WORKFLOW.md](workflows/DOCUMENTATION_MIGRATION_WORKFLOW.md) for documentation standards
2. Check [patterns/](patterns/) for code patterns to follow
3. Read [research/](research/) for technical context
4. Implement feature following TDD/BDD/DDD workflows
5. Document learnings in research/ or patterns/

**Example**:
```bash
# 1. Read documentation workflow
cat docs/dev-docs/workflows/DOCUMENTATION_MIGRATION_WORKFLOW.md

# 2. Check patterns
ls docs/dev-docs/patterns/

# 3. Implement feature (TDD example)
# - Write failing test
# - Implement minimal code to pass
# - Refactor
# - Repeat

# 4. Document learnings
vim docs/dev-docs/research/new-learning.md
```

---

### Workflow 2: Understanding Chora-Base Architecture

**Steps**:
1. Read root [ARCHITECTURE.md](../../ARCHITECTURE.md) for 4-domain model
2. Read [research/CLAUDE_Complete.md](research/CLAUDE_Complete.md) for Claude-specific insights
3. Explore [patterns/](patterns/) for code organization
4. Review [workflows/](workflows/) for development processes

**Example**:
```bash
# 1. Read architecture
cat docs/ARCHITECTURE.md

# 2. Read Claude learnings
cat docs/dev-docs/research/CLAUDE_Complete.md

# 3. Check patterns
ls docs/dev-docs/patterns/

# 4. Review workflows
ls docs/dev-docs/workflows/
```

---

### Workflow 3: Setting Up Development Environment

**Steps**:
1. Clone repository
2. Install dependencies (Python, Node.js, Docker as needed)
3. Set up pre-commit hooks (SAP-006: quality-gates)
4. Run tests to verify setup
5. Read [workflows/](workflows/) for development process

**Example**:
```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/liminalcommons/chora-base.git
cd chora-base

# 2. Install Python dependencies (if needed)
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# 3. Set up pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# 4. Run tests
pytest

# 5. Read development workflow
cat docs/dev-docs/workflows/DOCUMENTATION_MIGRATION_WORKFLOW.md
```

---

### Workflow 4: Researching Technical Decisions

**Steps**:
1. Check [research/](research/) directory for existing investigations
2. Read relevant research documents
3. If no existing research, conduct investigation
4. Document findings in new research document

**Example**:
```bash
# 1. Search research directory
ls docs/dev-docs/research/

# 2. Read relevant research
cat docs/dev-docs/research/adopter-learnings-executable-docs.md

# 3. If conducting new research, create document
vim docs/dev-docs/research/new-investigation.md

# 4. Follow research template (explanation, findings, recommendations)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't find development process

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check workflows directory
ls docs/dev-docs/workflows/

# Check static-template for TDD/BDD/DDD workflows
ls static-template/dev-docs/workflows/

# Search research for insights
grep -r "{keyword}" docs/dev-docs/research/
```

---

### Issue: Don't understand technical decision

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check research directory
ls docs/dev-docs/research/

# Read relevant research document
cat docs/dev-docs/research/{document}.md

# If not documented, check git history
git log --all --grep="{keyword}"
```

---

### Issue: Code pattern unclear

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check patterns directory
ls docs/dev-docs/patterns/

# Search existing code for examples
grep -r "{pattern}" .
