# Research Tasks

This directory contains research tasks for mcp-orchestration development.

**Context:** All research tasks reference the ecosystem alignment documents for shared architectural context.

## Ecosystem Integration Documentation

**For peer repositories integrating with mcp-orchestration:**

- **[ECOSYSTEM_INTEGRATION.md](./ECOSYSTEM_INTEGRATION.md)** - Complete integration guide
  - What is mcp-orchestration and when to use it
  - 4 integration patterns (client, frontend, n8n, gateway)
  - Capability manifest and ecosystem standards
  - Implementation examples and migration paths
  - Status: ✅ Active (v1.0.0, 2025-10-24)

- **[INTEGRATION_QUICK_REFERENCE.md](./INTEGRATION_QUICK_REFERENCE.md)** - Quick reference
  - 30-second integration guide
  - Pattern selection decision tree
  - Code snippets and common questions
  - Status: ✅ Active (v1.0.0, 2025-10-24)

## Active Research

### Tier 0: Critical NOW (Blocking E2E)

| Task | Status | Priority | Blocks | Assignee |
|------|--------|----------|--------|----------|
| [n8n API Key Storage (Simple)](./n8n-api-key-storage-simple.md) | ✅ Solved | P0 | E2E testing | Victor |

**Simple Solution:**
- Manual API key creation via n8n UI is acceptable
- Store in `.env` file (existing pattern)
- Document in E2E test guide
- **Complex automation research deferred to later**

**Status:** Using simple `.env` approach for now

## Planned Research

### Tier 1: Important SOON (Before Friends)

| Task | Status | Priority | Blocks | Target Phase |
|------|--------|----------|--------|--------------|
| [n8n API Key Bootstrap Automation](./n8n-api-key-bootstrap.md) | ⏸️ Deferred | P1 | CI/CD, installer automation | Phase 2 |
| Peer-to-Peer Discovery Protocol | ⏸️ Deferred | P1 | Friend distribution | Phase 3 |
| Mac/Windows Installer Strategy | ⏸️ Deferred | P1 | Friend onboarding | Phase 2 |

**Deferred Until:** E2E tests passing with manual approach, before creating installers

### Tier 2: Important LATER (Hybrid Architecture)

| Task | Status | Priority | Blocks | Target Phase |
|------|--------|----------|--------|--------------|
| n8n Backup/Restore Strategies | ⏸️ Deferred | P2 | Production deployment | Phase 4 |
| Cloud Service Integration | ⏸️ Deferred | P2 | Cloud deployment | Phase 4 |
| Hybrid Ecosystem Architecture | ⏸️ Deferred | P2 | Scaling | Phase 4 |

**Deferred Until:** Friend distribution complete, cloud deployment planned

### Tier 3: Future Vision

| Task | Status | Priority | Blocks | Target Phase |
|------|--------|----------|--------|--------------|
| Godot Integration Architecture | ⏸️ Deferred | P3 | Game world deployment | Phase 5 |
| Ecosystem Coordination Services | ⏸️ Deferred | P3 | Ecosystem scaling | Phase 5 |

**Deferred Until:** Hybrid cloud architecture deployed
