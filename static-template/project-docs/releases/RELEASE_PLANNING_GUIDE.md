|-------------|--------|--------------|------------------|
| **Breaking API change** | High | MAJOR | High (hours-days) |
| **Remove deprecated feature** | High | MAJOR | Medium (hours) |
| **Add new feature** | Medium | MINOR | Low (minutes) |
| **Improve performance** | Medium | MINOR | None (automatic) |
| **Fix bug** | Low | PATCH | None (automatic) |
| **Security patch** | Variable | PATCH | None (automatic) |

**Examples**:

```python
# Breaking change ‚Üí MAJOR
# v1.x: def process(data: dict) -> dict:
# v2.0: def process(data: DataModel) -> Result:  # Type change!

# New feature ‚Üí MINOR
# v1.5: (no analytics)
# v1.6: def get_analytics() -> AnalyticsReport:  # New function!

# Bug fix ‚Üí PATCH
# v1.5.0: Bug in error handling
# v1.5.1: Fixed error handling (no API change)
```

### Step 2: Define Release Scope

**Scope Elements**:
1. **Target Sprints** - Which sprints contribute to this release?
2. **Features** - What new capabilities?

```markdown
## v1.6.0 Release Retrospective

### What Went Well ‚úÖ

- RC testing caught 2 critical bugs before production
- Deployment was smooth (30 minutes, zero downtime)
- Documentation was comprehensive and accurate
- User feedback overwhelmingly positive

### What Could Be Improved ‚ö†Ô∏è

- RC testing took 7 days (target: 5 days)
  - Issue: UAT coordination delays
  - Solution: Schedule UAT testers earlier

- Post-release monitoring was manual
  - Issue: No automated alerts configured
  - Solution: Set up DataDog/New Relic alerts

### Action Items for Next Release

- [ ] Implement automated monitoring alerts (Owner: DevOps, Due: v1.7.0)
- [ ] Schedule UAT testers 2 weeks before RC (Owner: PM, Due: v1.7.0 planning)
- [ ] Create deployment runbook for on-call team (Owner: Eng Lead, Due: Sprint 9)

### Lessons Learned

1. **DDD/BDD/TDD prevented rework**: Zero features had to be reworked after merge
2. **Performance testing early paid off**: No surprises in production
3. **Upgrade guide testing is essential**: Found 2 errors in migration steps during RC
```

## Release Cadence

### Recommended Release Frequency

| Project Type | MAJOR | MINOR | PATCH |
|--------------|-------|-------|-------|
| **Fast-moving startup** | 6-12 months | 2-4 weeks | As needed |
| **Established product** | 12-24 months | 4-8 weeks | Weekly |
| **Enterprise/regulated** | 24+ months | 8-12 weeks | Bi-weekly |
| **Library/Framework** | 12-18 months | 8-12 weeks | As needed |

**chora-base Recommendation**: **4-6 week MINOR release cycle** (aligns with 2-3 sprints)

**Why 4-6 Weeks?**:
- ‚úÖ Enough time to deliver meaningful features (2-3 sprints)
- ‚úÖ Frequent enough to get user feedback quickly
- ‚úÖ Manageable overhead for docs, testing, communication

**PATCH Releases**: As needed for critical bugs or security issues

### Release Calendar

**Example 6-Month Release Plan**:

| Version | Type | Planned Date | Sprints | Key Features |
|---------|------|--------------|---------|--------------|
| v1.6.0 | MINOR | 2025-02-15 | 5-6 | OAuth2, Analytics |
| v1.6.1 | PATCH | 2025-02-22 | - | Critical bug fix |
| v1.7.0 | MINOR | 2025-04-01 | 7-9 | Export, Notifications |
| v1.8.0 | MINOR | 2025-05-15 | 10-12 | Advanced search |
| v2.0.0 | MAJOR | 2025-07-01 | 13-16 | New plugin system |

**Communication**:
- Publish release calendar in README.md
- Update quarterly (adjust dates based on actual progress)
- Communicate delays early (better to delay than ship incomplete)

---

## Release Anti-Patterns

### ‚ùå Anti-Pattern: No Release Planning

**Problem**:
```
"Sprint 6 is done, let's release!"
- No release document
- No changelog
- No upgrade testing
- No communication plan
```

**Impact**:
- Users surprised by breaking changes
- Support tickets flood in
- Rollback required

**Solution**:
```markdown
‚úÖ GOOD: Planned Release

- Release plan created 2 weeks before target date
- All sections completed (features, testing, docs, communication)
- RC testing conducted (7 days)
- Go/No-Go meeting held
- Communication prepared in advance
```

---

### ‚ùå Anti-Pattern: Skipping RC Testing

**Problem**:
```
"All tests pass in CI, ship directly to production!"
```

**Impact**:
- Integration issues discovered in production
- Data migration fails on real data
- Performance issues under load

**Solution**:
```markdown
‚úÖ GOOD: RC Testing on Staging

- Deploy RC1 to staging (identical to production)
- Run full test suite on staging
- Conduct load testing
- Test upgrade path with real data
- UAT with stakeholders
- Fix issues, deploy RC2 if needed
```

---

### ‚ùå Anti-Pattern: "It Compiles, Ship It"

**Problem**:
```
Quality Gates:
- [ ] Tests passing (75% coverage)
- [x] CI/CD passing
- [ ] Documentation incomplete
- [ ] 5 critical bugs open
- [ ] No upgrade guide
```

**Impact**:
- Users can't upgrade (no migration guide)
- Bugs discovered in production
- Support team overwhelmed

**Solution**:
```markdown
‚úÖ GOOD: Quality Gates Met

- [x] Tests passing (93% coverage)
- [x] CI/CD passing
- [x] Documentation complete
- [x] 0 critical/high bugs open
- [x] Upgrade guide tested
- [x] Stakeholder approval
```

---

### ‚ùå Anti-Pattern: Friday Deployments

**Problem**:
```
Deploy v1.6.0 on Friday at 5 PM
‚Üí Critical bug discovered at 6 PM
‚Üí On-call team scrambles over weekend
```

**Impact**:
- Weekend on-call stress
- Delayed rollback (team unavailable)
- User frustration (issue not fixed until Monday)

**Solution**:
```markdown
‚úÖ GOOD: Tuesday-Thursday Deployment

Deploy v1.6.0 on Tuesday at 10 AM
- Support team available all day
- Time to monitor and fix issues same day
- Weekend free for team
- Users get timely support
```

**Exception**: Emergency security patches (deploy immediately, any day)
