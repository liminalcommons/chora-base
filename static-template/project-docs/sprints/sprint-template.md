## Capacity Planning

### Team Capacity

| Team Member | Available Hours | Committed Hours | Buffer (20%) | Notes |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|--------------|-------|
| [Name/Agent] | 40 | 32 | 8 | [e.g., "On-call rotation"] |
| [Name/Agent] | 40 | 32 | 8 | [e.g., "Half-day meetings"] |
| **Total** | **80** | **64** | **16** | |

**Velocity**: [N] story points (based on last 3 sprints average)

### Story Point Allocation

| Priority | Story Points | Hours Estimate | % of Capacity |
|----------|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| High (Must Have) | [N] | [N] | [N]% |
| Medium (Should Have) | [N] | [N] | [N]% |
| Low (Nice to Have) | [N] | [N] | [N]% |
| Technical Debt | [N] | [N] | [N]% |
| **Total** | **[N]** | **[N]** | **[N]%** |

**Capacity Health**:
- ‚úÖ Green: <80% committed (healthy buffer)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Yellow: 80-95% committed (tight but manageable)
- üî¥ Red: >95% committed (over-committed, risk of burnout)

|------|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|
| [Risk description] | High/Medium/Low | High/Medium/Low | [How to mitigate] | [Name] |
| [External dependency delay] | High | Medium | [Parallel work, backup plan] | [Name] |
| [Technical complexity unknown] | Medium | High | [Spike/POC first, expert consultation] | [Name] |
