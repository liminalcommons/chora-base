SAP-009 (Agent Awareness) Improvements**\n- Learned from SAP-010/015 L3 work: better ROI tracking patterns\n- Could add A-MEM + beads integration examples\n- Progressive context loading patterns working well (could document more)\n\n**4. Documentation Quality**\n- Missing YAML frontmatter in many AGENTS.md files (SAP-001, SAP-002, SAP-004+)\n- Could improve consistency across SAP awareness files\n- Link validation infrastructure exists (SAP-016) but needs active use\n\n**5.
