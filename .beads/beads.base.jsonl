SAP-009 (Agent Awareness) Improvements**\n- Learned from SAP-010/015 L3 work: better ROI tracking patterns\n- Could add A-MEM + beads integration examples\n- Progressive context loading patterns working well (could document more)\n\n**4. Documentation Quality**\n- Missing YAML frontmatter in many AGENTS.md files (SAP-001, SAP-002, SAP-004+)\n- Could improve consistency across SAP awareness files\n- Link validation infrastructure exists (SAP-016) but needs active use\n\n**5. New SAP Opportunities** (if needed)\n- None critical - focus on deepening existing SAPs first\n- SAP-029 (SAP Generation) could be formalized (Plan A from earlier)\n- But dogfooding existing infrastructure is higher ROI\n\n**Recommendation Ranking**:\n1. 🔥 Dogfood SAP-015 + SAP-010 for 2-3 months (production data)\n2. 🎯 Fix YAML frontmatter gaps (quick wins, improves consistency)\n3. 📊 Add test coverage to close SAP-004 gap\n4. 📚 Document lessons learned from L3 work (improve SAP-009)\n5. 🆕 Consider new SAPs only after existing ones reach L2/L3","created_at":"2025-11-16T02:29:15Z"}]}
